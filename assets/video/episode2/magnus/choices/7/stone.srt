1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Stone it is.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not bad. Not bad. Guess it'll have to do.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So what are you doing over there on his side?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, I thought you might bring that up.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's just that Reuben wanted to take your corner,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and I didn't want to crowd him or anything,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so I thought I'd watch from over here.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take your best shot!

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And that's how you shouldn't throw an egg.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ha! You grief with me, you grief with the best!

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, amulet holder, taking an amulet isn't enough.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You need to take my crown as well.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I do not discriminate in my accessory taking.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your crown shall be mine.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You are but a student.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,062
Prepare yourself, for I am here to give you your final

17
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,000
blessing.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That was just a warning!

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What? A warning that you need glasses?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It seems the student has become the master,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and the amulet holder will win the day.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know what that means, but I love it!

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to put it on a T-shirt!

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But what happened to eating hit by my team teeth?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nobody messes with the boom master!

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Jesse! Jesse, you okay?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Had enough yet?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Alrighty, I think nuke time is over.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to go get the amulet holder.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll be right back.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,435
We've had some nice laughs, but now they must come to a

32
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,000
close.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And you should run home!
