00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello boomtown, how we all doing, huh?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
Hey, that's awesome

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,096
So proud standing in front of you all today. Well you guys

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,040
ready then

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,520
Wait, what's going on? Oh, well, that's not good

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Help me! What are we?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, red messing boomtown, go!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, just a little farther

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wow, someone really went bonkers with the defenses, huh?

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who goes there? Oh, Jesse?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, Jesse?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, Jesse?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, Jesse?

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, Jesse?

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,063
Who goes there? Oh, Jesse? Is that you? Lukas, did you

16
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:33,760
build all of this?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,002
Well, yeah, I figured I would try and fortify the place,

18
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:38,760
you know?

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Nice!

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,918
Quick, come on. You guys are never gonna believe who showed

21
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:44,760
up while you were gone

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Gabriel

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Hello everyone, it is good to see you

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
He showed up not too long before you guys

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,520
You always were a tough cookie to keep down

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,520
It's good to see you too, you meathead

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,199
And it's especially good to see you, Jesse. I fear that you

28
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,320
might be the last face I ever saw

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Getting here was hard

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
But it was worth it

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Thank you for watching
