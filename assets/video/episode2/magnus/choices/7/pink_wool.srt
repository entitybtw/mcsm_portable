1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, whoa it is.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Not bad. Not bad. Guess it'll have to do.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Axel, what are you doing over there on his side?

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, thought you might bring that up.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,446
It's just that Reuben wanted to take your corner and I

6
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,938
didn't want to crowd him or anything, so I thought I'd

7
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:38,000
watch from over here.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take your best shot!

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And that's how you shouldn't throw an egg.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ha! You grieve with me, you grieve with the best!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,833
So, amulet holder, taking an amulet isn't enough. You need

12
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,000
to take my crown as well.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,732
I do not discriminate in my accessory taking. Your crown

14
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,000
shall be mine.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,705
You are but a student. Prepare yourself, for I am here to

16
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:27,000
give you your final lesson.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That was just a warning!

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What? A warning that you need glasses?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,475
It seems the student has become the master and the amulet

20
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,000
holder will win the day.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,093
I don't know what that means, but I love it! I want to put

22
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,000
it on a t-shirt!

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But what happened to getting hit by my TNT?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nobody messes with the boom master!

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Jesse! Jesse, you okay?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You had enough yet?

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Alrighty, I think noob time is over.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,548
We've had some nice laughs, but now they must come to a

29
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,000
close.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you should run home!
