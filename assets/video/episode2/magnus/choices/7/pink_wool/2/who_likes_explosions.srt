1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Who likes explosions?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
That's right, yeah you do.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
That's why I'm standing up here today.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Well, you guys ready then?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh, yeah! This'll be a way easier target than Magnus.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait, what's going on?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,700
Oh, well, that's not good.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,600
Is that your wither storm?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
How are we? What do we?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, just a little farther.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wow, someone really went bonkers with the defenses, huh?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Who goes there?

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Oh, Jesse? Is that you?

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
No, it's not Jesse.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Jesse, you're not going to get away with this.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to get you.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Who goes there?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, Jesse? Is that you?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Lukas, did you build all of this?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,242
Well, yeah. I figured I would try and fortify the place,

21
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:38,000
you know?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice!

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,918
Quick, come on. You guys are never going to believe who

24
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,000
showed up while you were gone.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Gabriel!

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello, everyone. It is good to see you.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
He showed up not too long before you guys.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Magnus, my old friend.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You always were a tough cookie to keep down.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
It's good to see you.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,000
It's good to see you too, your meathead.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And it's especially good to see you, Jesse.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I fear that you might be the last face I ever saw.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Getting here was hard.
