1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Yeah, and you two are going to have to get along, okay?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,680
We didn't even know you were gonna be here.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,000
If he's nice, I'll be nice too.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
It was kind of crazy, actually.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,600
I went to Redstonia,

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,280
and there were all these incredible engineers and inventors.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,760
It was a little intimidating, actually.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,920
But Ellegaard's made me her protege.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,640
Well, assistant for now.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,720
She might have, well, embarrassed herself a tiny bit.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,600
Yeah.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,360
But after I pled my case,

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,057
she agreed to take me on as her assistant and come back to

14
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:33,440
help.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
Not bad, right?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
Well, I'm the king of Boon Town.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
Very impressive.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,720
Hooray! It's Ellie.

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,840
And here I was just starting to enjoy myself.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
Hello, Magnus.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
Your voice is exactly as pleasant as I remember.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,560
Which is to say, not at all.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,880
Oh, my feelings.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,080
Is that the same way you're gonna use to save the world?

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Why? You here to tell me how to do it better?

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
I would never dream of doing that.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,604
Unlike you, I actually do things instead of just talking

28
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,480
about them.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,040
Hey, that's Ellegaardd you're talking to.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,160
Show her some respect.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Wow, you finally found yourself a live one.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,140
Hey.

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,194
Your little devotees are usually a little more on the

34
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,080
bookish side.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,440
Leave her out of this, Magnus.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
This is between the two of us.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,040
Oh, I started ignoring her ages ago.
