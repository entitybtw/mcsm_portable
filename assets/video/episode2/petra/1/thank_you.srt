00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thanks for coming back, Lukas. I mean that.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jump!

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,862
Oh, be quiet! It's just a pointless building. That's all

4
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm saying. I mean, look at...

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Magnus, if an artist painted the inside of your mind, he'd

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,000
end up with the most extraordinary desertscape paintings.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,137
That's it! I'm going! Once again, it falls to me to take

8
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:04,000
care of everything. I'll find this Super TNT myself.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, no, no, no! You do not get to be the one who walks away!

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's it! I'm going!

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
See? I'm walking away too now! Super TNT, here I come!

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,111
It's hard to pick glass half full when they keep kicking

13
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:23,000
the glass over.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,308
Bickering is kind of their deal. But hopefully they'll work

15
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:29,000
things out and get on with the important stuff.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What are we going to do now? Where should we go?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's figure it out.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thanks for watching!
