1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Elegant, I'm sorry, but no, I can't let you do this. Please

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,720
we have to go go

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,266
This seems terribly short-sighted. I had thought you were

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,000
the brains of your little trio

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,203
This could be the greatest invention the world has ever

6
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:17,160
seen it could change everything

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,540
You'll understand when you see it. I promise there's no time

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,060
While I'm very glad you want my assistance and trust me I

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,920
won't faint I'm still not sure

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Oh my surface

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,434
So so sorry we should get to the portal now as soon as

12
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:41,440
possible

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,935
Okay, just a little farther, wow, that's certainly

16
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,320
impressive Wow

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,080
There oh Jesse is that you Lukas did you build all of this

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,451
Quick come on. You guys are never gonna believe who showed

19
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,360
up while you were gone

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Petra hey guys, how's it going?

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,469
I'm so glad you're okay Petra. Yeah, I'm pretty stoked

22
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,640
about it myself

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,634
It's really good to see you Jesse back there in Gabriel's

24
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,000
bunker. I got pretty dicey

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
