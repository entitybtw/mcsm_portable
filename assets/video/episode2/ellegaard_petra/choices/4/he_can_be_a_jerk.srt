1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,267
Yeah, he's kind of a jerk sometimes, but he's our jerk, you

2
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:03,600
know?

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,960
Can't help but like him.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
Interesting. Very interesting.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,720
Then why didn't you listen to his plan to come get me?

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,680
I figured that we needed Brains to fight the Witherstorm.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,920
And Brains means Eligard.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, I've definitely heard that a lot.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,760
I'll try not to let it hurt my feelings too much.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, just keep on your toes.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Uh, guys?

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
I told you he was gonna catch up with us.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Oh, boy. You really weren't kidding.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
No. Not again.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
We can hash all that out later.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Not again. Not again.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Zords isn't much farther than this.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Zords isn't much farther. We can make it.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I am getting very tired of this Witherstorm.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Agreed.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Soren's place is gone.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm gonna go check on the other side.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Okay.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
I am getting very tired of this Witherstorm.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Agreed.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
Soren's place has gotta be just ahead. Come on!

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Soren really lived down here?

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
It's so far from...

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
anyone.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Enchanting, isn't it?

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Aw, come on! It's fine! Look! Woohoo!

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Just don't fall, okay?

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Oh, that is deep. That is very, very deep.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Hang on! I'm coming!

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh, man. We've got Endermen.

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
It was, uh...

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
more of a drop than I was expecting.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Endermen.

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,851
There are so many, I didn't think they ever came in groups

42
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:09,440
that big.

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
No kidding.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm not kidding.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm not kidding.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
It's like an Endermen party.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
I heard your voice and thought I would come down to help.
