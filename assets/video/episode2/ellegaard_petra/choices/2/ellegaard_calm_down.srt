1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,676
Ellegaardd, come on. I know this isn't how the plan was

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,000
supposed to go, but it's going to be fine. Ha!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fine.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,466
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture? We

5
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,932
have a very hungry wither storm in the process of turning

6
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,000
the whole world into its dinner.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,472
It was terrifying. It came out of nowhere and just

8
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,000
destroyed everything.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,508
Little too scary for you, Ellie? Couldn't just think it

10
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:30,000
away?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,666
You weren't there, Magnus. I'm telling you, this thing was

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,000
like nothing I've ever seen.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,492
Why? Because it's never come inside one of your little

14
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:38,000
workshops?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would you two stop fighting?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,055
Whoa! Yikes. Jesse's right. We need to find some way to

17
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,000
stop that thing.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,079
Well, I don't know if you've had the chance to poke around

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,000
this old dump yet, but it's pretty much stripped bare.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can we start crafting some, then?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't think we got that kind of time.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,758
If only Soren were here, he might have something we could

25
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:09,000
use.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, Ellie. Not this again.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's something stronger than TNT?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,461
Soren had a kind of super TNT. Stronger and more explosive

29
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,000
than anything else in the world.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The Formidabomb.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,838
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect. We should go get it

33
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:32,000
now.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,253
Well, there's a little problem there. We don't know where

35
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:38,000
Soren is.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But you found us. Do you know where he is?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Our map could locate him.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Unless he's in the nether, or the end.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But it's worth a shot.
