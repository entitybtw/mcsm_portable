1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
You're the genius, Eligar. Let's get started.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Fantastic.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,522
Okay, excellent. Good. This is so exciting. Terribly

4
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,200
exciting.

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,600
Has it gotten this far before?

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
No, never!

7
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Is it... destabilizing?

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Oh, no!

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Eligar, come on!

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
We need to go! We need to get to the portal!

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Over here!

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
This way!

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Captain!

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Okay, just a little farther.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Wow, that's certainly impressive.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Wow.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Who goes there?

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Oh, Jesse? Is that you?

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Lucas, did you build all of this?

20
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, yeah.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
I figured I would try and fortify the portal.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Yeah! I figured I would try and fortify the place, you know?

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Nice!

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,901
Quick, come on! You guys are never gonna believe who showed

25
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,000
up while you were gone.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Petra!

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Hey, guys. How's it going?

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm so glad you're okay, Petra.

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah, I'm pretty stoked about it myself.

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,600
And it's really good to see you, Jesse.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Back there in Gabriel's bunker, it got pretty dicey.
