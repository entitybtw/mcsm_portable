1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,676
Eligard, come on. I know this isn't how the plan was

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,000
supposed to go, but it's going to be fine. Ha!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fine.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,466
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture? We

5
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,932
have a very hungry wither storm in the process of turning

6
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,000
the whole world into its dinner.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,333
It was terrifying. It came out of nowhere and just

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,000
destroyed... everything.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,508
Little too scary for you, Ellie? Couldn't just think it

10
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:30,000
away?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,666
You weren't there, Magnus. I'm telling you, this thing was

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,000
like nothing I've ever seen.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,492
Why? Because it's never come inside one of your little

14
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:38,000
workshops?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would you two stop fighting?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Whoa! Yikes.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,257
Jesse speaks the truth. We must find a way to defeat that

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,000
monstrosity.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,592
Well, I don't know if you've had the chance to poke around

20
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:56,000
this old dump yet, but it's pretty much stripped bare.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can we start crafting some, then?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't think we got that kind of time.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,677
If only Sorin were here, he might have something we could

26
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:11,000
use.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, Ellie. Not this again.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's something stronger than TNT?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sorin had a kind of super TNT.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Formidabomb.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,758
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect. We should go get it

34
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:34,000
now.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, there's a little problem there.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We don't know where Sorin is.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But you found us. Do you know where he is?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Our map could locate him.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Unless he's in the nether or the end.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it's worth a shot.
