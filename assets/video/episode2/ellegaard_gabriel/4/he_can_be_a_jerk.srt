1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,277
Yeah, he's kind of a jerk sometimes, but he's our jerk, you

2
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:05,000
know? Can't help but like him.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,023
Interesting. Very interesting. Then why didn't you listen

4
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,000
to his plan to come get me?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,433
I figured that we needed Brains to fight the Witherstorm.

6
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,000
And Brains means Ellegaardd.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,977
Yeah, I've definitely heard that a lot. I'll try not to let

8
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:22,000
it hurt my feelings too much.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, just keep on your toes.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Uh, guys?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I told you he was going to catch up with us.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You really weren't kidding.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No. How could he find me again?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,450
We can hatch all that out later. Come on, we've got to get

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,000
out of here!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This creature never stops.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Sorens isn't much farther. We can make it.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm getting very tired of this Witherstorm.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Agreed.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Sorens' place has got to be just ahead of us.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, it's a good idea.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think we should go and check it out.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, I think we should go and check it out.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm getting very tired of this Witherstorm.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Agreed.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Sorens' place has got to be just ahead. Come on!

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Soren really lived down here? It's so far from... anyone.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Enchanting, isn't it?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Aw, come on! It's fine! Look! Woo!

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Just don't fall, okay?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, that is deep. That is very, very deep.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hang on! I'm coming!

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hang on! I'm coming!

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, man, we've got Enderman.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It was more of a drop than I was expecting.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Enderman.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,420
There were so many, I didn't think they ever came in groups

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,000
that big.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No kidding. It's like an Enderman party.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I heard your voice and thought I would come down to help.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
