1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Who likes explosions?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
That's right, yeah you do.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
That's why I'm standing up here today.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Well, you guys ready then?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh, yeah! This'll be a way easier target than Magnus.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait, what's going on?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,700
Oh, well, that's not good.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,600
Is that your wither storm?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
How are we? What do we?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, just a little farther.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wow, someone really went bonkers with the defenses, huh?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Who goes there?

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Oh, Jesse? Is that you?

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
No, it's not Jesse.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Jesse, you're not going to get away with this.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You're going to get away with this.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Jesse, you're not going to get away with this.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Jesse, is that you?

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Lukas, did you build all of this?

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,742
Well, yeah. I figured I would try and fortify the place,

21
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:38,500
you know?

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Nice!

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,058
Quick, come on. You guys are never going to believe who

24
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,500
showed up while you were gone.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Petra!

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Hey guys, how's it going?

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Petra, you made it!

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
It's good to see you too, big guy.

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
And it's really good to see you, Jesse.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Back there in Gabriel's bunker, it got pretty dicey.
