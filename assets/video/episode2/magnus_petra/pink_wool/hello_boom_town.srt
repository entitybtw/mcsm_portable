Okay, just a little farther

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wow, someone really went bonkers with the defenses, huh?

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who goes there? Oh, Jesse?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Who goes there? Oh, Jesse? Is that you?

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Lukas, did you build all of this?

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,393
Well, yeah, I figured I would try and fortify the place,

17
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:38,000

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice!

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,158
Quick, come on, you guys are never gonna believe who showed

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey guys, how's it going?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What? What? What? What?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Petra, you made it!

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's good to see you too, big guy

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And it's really good to see you, Jesse

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
