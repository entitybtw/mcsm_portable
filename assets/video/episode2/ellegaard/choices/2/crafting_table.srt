1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, I can do this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Redstone repeater, redstone repeater, redstone repeater.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Done. Pretty nice.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If I make up one of myself.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, that's a step in the right direction.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Bam! Door open.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Switch is on.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, good, good.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wow, here it is.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ellegaardd's redstone laboratory.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Seems more like an entrance or a foyer or something.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't worry, pal, we'll find her.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I just hope she can actually help us.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,531
That might be the most redstone stuff I've ever seen in my

15
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,000
life.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can say that again.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She's moving a lot of different ingredients around here.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Man, look at all this, huh?

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,029
Whatever she's working on, if it requires all of these

20
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,000
ingredients,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it must be something really, really big.
