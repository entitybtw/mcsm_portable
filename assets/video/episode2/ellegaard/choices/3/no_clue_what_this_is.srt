1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, I don't want to alarm you, Olivia, but...

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
I have no idea what I'm looking at here.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
I don't know what it is yet either.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
That's why I'm studying it.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Come on, let's keep moving.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,200
Seems like this place has really blown you away.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,400
You're not kidding.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,000
This is like everything I've ever dreamed of.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Entering Eligard's laboratory, seeing her right there...

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,956
She'll ask me to be her apprentice, and the next thing you

11
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:10,000
know we'll be changing the world together.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's just try to save the world first.

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,850
Whoa! Hi! Hey! Didn't see you sneaking up on me. Guess

14
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,200
that's the point.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,286
Don't touch anything in here, okay? It's all supremely

16
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:23,800
fragile and genius.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,000
Did Calvin send you? You my new assistants?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
New assistants with a stupidly adorable pig, that is!

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Jessie! She thinks we're her new assistants!

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is so exciting!
