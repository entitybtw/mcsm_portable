1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,709
Ellegaardd, we've actually got much bigger problems to deal

2
00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:03,000
with.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're actually here to get your help.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,555
There's a giant wither storm that's attacking the entire

5
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:09,000
world.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A wither what? What are you talking about? Who sent you?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Gabriel sent me.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,277
Look, you both seem like very pleasant people who are prone

9
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,000
to fainting,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but I simply don't have the brain power for this.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm in the middle of my greatest project to date.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A powerful block capable of altering reality itself.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've seen one of those before. It's a command block.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,375
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How do you know what a command

15
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,000
block is?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We've seen one up close before. It was Ivor's.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He's done something terrible with it.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,612
The world needs the Order of the Stone. That's why we're

19
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:47,000
here.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,767
Sorry to bust your circuits, but the Order isn't really

21
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,000
together anymore.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We, uh, sort of disassembled.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's actually kind of why we're here.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Gabriel's amulet.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, he gave it to me so that I could find the Order.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,677
Your wither storm problem was created by a command block,

27
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:08,000
yes?

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,272
That means a command block could be the perfect way of

29
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,000
beating it.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And maybe...

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Will you help me make one?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's going to work this time.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can feel it.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Right here. In my brain.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I could help too.
