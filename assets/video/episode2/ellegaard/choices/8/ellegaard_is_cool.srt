00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,097
Hey, Eligard is cool and she's going to help stop this

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:03,900
wither storm.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,600
Ellie? Cool?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,900
Ah! Oh, wait, wait, you're serious?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh wow, that's uh, that's uh, woo! Oh boy!

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,949
I got tired of waiting around so I decided to go recruit

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,900
Magnus myself.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,843
It was kind of a crazy adventure, but it all worked out in

9
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:24,300
the end.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,000
And now, I'm the king of Boomtown!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
Boomtown?

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,929
That's the name of Magnus' kingdom. I had to beat him in a

13
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,100
crazy tournament and...

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
Long story, you had to be there.

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,319
Short version, epic battle of explosions and mayhem,

16
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,600
death-defying action, shenanigans, and pyrotechnics.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Bada bing, bada boom!

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,624
Your friend here is kind of supreme ruler of my kingdom

19
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,600
now, you know what I mean.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
Well, this is unexpected.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,057
I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but I'm definitely

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,000
sure that I don't like it.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah, show him some respect.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Oh, you're sticking up for Magnus, that's very... sweet.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Yeah, he's sticking up for me.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
It's because I'm really awesome and super cool.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I'll never understand your fans.
