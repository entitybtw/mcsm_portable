1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I never doubted you for a second, but that was incredible.

2
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
Maybe we have a chance of getting to Ellegaardd after all.

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Look, there's the sign. Redstonia. Redstonia, here we come.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,411
We're about to meet the greatest redstone builders in the

5
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:49,840
world.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,962
Wow, who would have thought that someday I'd really get to

7
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:54,960
visit Redstonia,

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,240
Ellegaardd's capital city of engineering. Incredible.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
Do you think Ellegaardd will be willing, you know, to help us?

10
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:06,873
Have you seen all these inventions? These inventors are all

11
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:09,280
incredible.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,712
I might know Redstone where we come from, but these people

13
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,000
are the real deal, Jesse.

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, I don't even know how they're making some of these

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,320
things.

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,040
That's rare for me.
