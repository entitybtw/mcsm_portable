1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, we're all set to go again.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Time to move, buddy.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hitting the path of trust.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I never doubted you for a second, but that was incredible.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Maybe we have a chance of getting to Ellegaardd after all.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Look, there's the sign.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Redstonia.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Redstonia, here we come.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,939
They're about to meet the greatest redstone builders in the

12
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,000
world.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Wow.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,247
Who would have thought that someday I'd really get to visit

15
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:57,000
Redstonia, Ellegaardd's capital city of engineering.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Incredible.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you think Ellegaardd will be willing, you know, to help us?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Have you seen all these inventions?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
These inventors are all incredible.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,452
I might know Redstone where we come from, but these people

21
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,000
are the real deal, Jesse.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,393
I mean, I don't even know how they're making some of these

23
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,000
things.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's rare for me.
