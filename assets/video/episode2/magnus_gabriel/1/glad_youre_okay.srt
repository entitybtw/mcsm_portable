00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's such a relief to see you. I'm glad you're okay.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you hadn't pulled me out of the Witherstorms' clutches...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, let's just not think about that.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,042
I came here to the temple, hoping against hope to find

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,000
other survivors.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wow, did Petra get away too? Did you see?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that creature left in its wake was Bedrock.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All those people...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your friend Petra...

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No one could get away.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are alive.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That means there's still hope.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Come along. Everyone else is still inside.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow! Been a while since I've been here.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What is SHE doing here?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This isn't going to go well.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right. I forgot to mention...

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Olivia went on a little...

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
expedition of her own while you were gone.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And this Olivia person...

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
came back with her?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Did you know about this?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Jesse! Jesse! Look! I found Ellegaardd!

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Just hang on a sec, okay?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll go figure out what's going on.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Good. You do that.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Easy now, Olivia. Let's try and play it cool.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, who are you now? And why did you bring HIM with you?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You
