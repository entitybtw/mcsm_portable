1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
I don't understand. How did you escape?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
If you hadn't pulled me out of the Witherstorm's clutches...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, let's just not think about that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,802
I came here to the temple, hoping against hope to find

5
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,000
other survivors.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wow, did Petra get away too? Did you see?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that creature left in its wake was bedrock.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All those people...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your friend Petra...

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No one could get away.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are alive.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That means there's still hope.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Come along. Everyone else is still inside.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wow! Been a while since I've been here.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What is SHE doing here?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, this isn't going to go well.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Right. I forgot to mention, Olivia went on a little...

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
expedition of her own while you were gone.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And this Olivia person...

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
came back with her?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you know about this?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jesse, Jesse! Look! I found Ellegaardd!

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,737
Just hang on a sec, okay? I'll go figure out what's going

24
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,000
on.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good. You do that.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Easy now, Olivia. Let's try and play it cool.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, who are you now? And why did you bring HIM with you?

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You
