1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
That was pretty reckless, Lucas. You could have gotten hurt.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,060
Orbit, jump!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to kill you!

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,218
Oh, be quiet! It's just a pointless building! That's all

5
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm saying! I mean, look at...

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,470
Magnus, if an artist painted the inside of your mind, he'd

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,000
end up with the most extraordinary desert-scape paintings.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's it! I'm going!

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,747
Once again, it falls to me to take care of everything. I'll

10
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,000
find this Super TNT myself.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, no, no, no! You do not get to be the one who walks away!

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's it! I'm going!

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
See? I'm walking away too now! Super TNT, here I come!

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,111
It's hard to pick glass half full when they keep kicking

15
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,000
the glass over.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,757
Bickering is kind of their deal. But hopefully they'll work

17
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:27,000
things out and get on with the important stuff.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What are we going to do now? Where should we go?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's figure it out.
