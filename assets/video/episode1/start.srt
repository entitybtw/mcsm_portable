1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Nothing built can last forever.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
And every legend, no matter how great, fades with time.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,500
With each passing year, more and more details are lost... until all that remains are myths. Half truths.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,800
To put it simply, lies.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,600
And yet in all the known universe, between here and the Far Lands...

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,600
The legend of the Order of the Stone endures, unabridged, as self-evident fact.

8
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,800
Indeed, it is only a troubled land that has need for heroes...

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:54,000
And ours was fortunate to have, so long ago, four heroes such as these:

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Gabriel the Warrior.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,400
Before whose sword all combatants would tremble.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,700
Ellegaard the Redstone Engineer.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,200
Whose machines would spark an era of invention.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,370
Magnus the Rogue.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,660
Who would channel his destructive creativity for the benefit of all.

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,500
And Soren the Architect...

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Builder of Worlds...

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,900
And leader of the Order of the Stone.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:29,300
These FOUR friends together, would give so much to gain their rightful place as FOUR heroes.

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:37,640
Their greatest quest would take them on a dangerous journey to fight a mysterious creature known as the Ender Dragon.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:50,890
In the end, the Order of the Stone emerged victorious and the dragon was defeated. Their story complete, they slipped away into the pages of legends.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,299
But when one story ends, another one begins...

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Would you rather fight a hundred chicken-sized zombies, or ten zombie-sized chickens?
