1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,599
Nothing built can last forever, and


2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,199
every legend, no matter how great, fades


3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,800
with time.


4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,746
With each passing year, more and more


5
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:19,693
details are lost, until all that remains


6
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:22,640
are myths,


7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
half-truths, to put it simply, lies.


8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,480
And yet in all the known universe,


9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,159
between here and the Far Lands, the


10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,840
legend of the


11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,619
Order of the Stone endures, unabridged


12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,399
as self-evident fact.


13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,933
Indeed, it is only a troubled land that


14
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,466
has need for heroes, and ours was


15
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,999
fortunate to


16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,820
have so long ago, four heroes such as


17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
these.


18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Gabriel the Warrior, before whom...


19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,880
The sword all combatants would tremble.


20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,320
Ellegaard, the redstone engineer, whose


21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,760
machines would spark an era of


22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,200
invention.


23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,359
Magnus the Rogue, who would channel his


24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,519
destructive creativity for the benefit


25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,680
of all.


26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,013
And Soren the Architect, builder of


27
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:18,346
worlds and leader of the Order of the


28
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,679
Stone.


29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
These four friends together would give


30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
so much to gain their rightful place.


31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,180
And so, the story of the Order of the


32
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,680
Stone ends.


33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,140
The story of the Order of the Stone


34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,599
ends.


35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,140
The story of the Order of the Stone


36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,640
ends.


37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,140
The story of the Order of the Stone


38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,640
ends.


39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,140
They have been identified as four


40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,640
heroes.


41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,973
Their greatest quest would take them on


42
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:34,306
a dangerous journey to fight a


43
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,639
mysterious creature


44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
known as the Ender Dragon.


45
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,386
In the end, the Order of the Stone


46
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,133
emerged victorious and the dragon


47
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,880
wasислaped.


48
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,040
Their story complete, they slipped away


49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
into the pages of legend.

50
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
But when one story ends,


51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,299
another one begins.


52
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,180
Would you rather fight


53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,259
a hundred chicken-sized zombies


54
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,400
or ten zombie-sized chickens?
