1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Nothing built can last forever.


2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,199
And every legend no matter how great,


3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,600
fades with time.


4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,920
With each passing year, more and more


5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,200
details are lost until all that remains


6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,640
are myths...


7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,800
half-truths. To put it simply: lies.


8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
And yet, in all the known universe,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,600
between here and the Far Lands...


10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,750
The legend of the


11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,300
ORDER OF THE STONE endures, unabridged,


12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,600
as self-evident fact.


13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,200
Indeed, it is only a troubled land that


14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,800
has need for heroes --


15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,999
And ours was fortunate to


16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
have, so long ago, four heroes such as these;


17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Gabriel the Warrior --


18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,400
Before whose sword all combatants would tremble.


19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,700
Ellegaard, the redstone engineer --


20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,200
Whose machines would spark an era of invention.


21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,370
Magnus the Rogue --


22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,519
Who would channel his destructive creativity


23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,660
for the benefit of all.


24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,500
And Soren the Architect --


25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Builder of worlds.


26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,900
And leader of the Order of the Stone.


27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,900
These FOUR friends together, would give


29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,300
so much to gain their rightful place as FOUR heroes.


31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,500
Their greatest quest would take them on


32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,800
a dangerous journey to fight a


33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
mysterious creature


34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,640
known as the Ender Dragon.


35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,900
In the end, the Order of the Stone


36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,300
emerged victorious and the dragon


37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,880
was defeated.


38
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,460
Their story complete, they slipped away


39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,890
into the pages of legend.


40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
But when one story ends,


41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,299
another one begins.


42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,180
Would you rather fight


43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,259
a hundred chicken-sized zombies


44
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,000
or ten zombie-sized chickens?
