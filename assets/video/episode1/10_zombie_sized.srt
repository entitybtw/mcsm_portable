1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,992
I have to go with the giant chickens, not because I want to

2
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:05,985
or because I think it would be easy, but because they would

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,398
be an abomination.

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,000
Imagine their giant feet.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Like I said, an abomination.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,893
So I've got a daylight sensor on the roof, and if I did

7
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:20,000
this right, these lamps should turn on once it gets dark.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,494
I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while

9
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,000
we're at the building competition.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's coming with us.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,610
Really?

12
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,149
What kind of question is that? Of course he is.

13
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:34,786
Okay, I'm not saying he shouldn't come. I'm not.

14
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:36,457
But don't you think it's a little weird that you take him

15
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:38,375
with you everywhere you go?

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,124
Reuben's my best friend.

17
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,837
I thought I was your best friend.

18
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,462
Both of you are.

19
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,961
I didn't mean anything by it. I'm glad he's coming. I just

20
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,018
don't want to give people one more reason to call us

21
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,175
losers.

22
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:54,150
Who cares what other people think?

23
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,500
I know. I'm just... it wears you down.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,362
You say you're not a loser, Olivia. So win.

25
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,975
Okay. Fine.

26
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,524
Do you hear that?

27
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,086
Oh, no.

28
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,140
Oh man. You guys totally freaked out. That was awes--

29
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,920
Axel, what's the matter with you?

30
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,099
Great. Now I'm going to smell like a pig in Endercon.

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,920
I thought we were buddies.
