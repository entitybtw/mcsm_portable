00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,398
I'd have to go with the giant chickens. Not because I want to or because I think it would be easy, but because they would be an abomination.

2
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,000
Imagine their giant feet.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
Like I said, an abomination.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:20,650
Soo... I’ve got a daylight sensor on the roof... And if I did this right, these lamps should turn on once it gets dark.

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,000
I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while we're at the building competition.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
He's coming with us.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,230
Really?

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,149
What kind of question is that? Of course he is.

9
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:38,705
Okay. I'm not saying he shouldn't come. I'm not... but don't you think it's a little weird that you take him with you everywhere you go?

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,124
Reuben’s my best friend.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,837
I thought I was your best friend.

12
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,462
Both of you are!

13
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,961
I didn’t mean anything by it. I’m glad he’s coming.

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,175
I just don’t wanna give people one more reason to call us “losers”.

15
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:54,150
Who CARES what other people think?!

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,500
I know, I just… it wears your down.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,362
You say you’re not a loser, Olivia! So WIN!

18
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,975
Okay. Fine.

19
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,524
Do you hear that?

20
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,086
Oh, no.

21
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,140
Hahaha! Oh, man you guys totally freaked out! That was awe-

22
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,920
Axel! What’s the matter with you?!

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,099
Great. Now I’m gonna smell like a pig at Endercon.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,920
I thought we were buddies!
