1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't wanna die!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Too many herk from prince, I don't want to die!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,800
No, my red.

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,540
No, no.

6
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,020
Stop it!

7
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,520
Shut up.

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
I said, shut up!

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:39,647
So, when we're making the deal, I need you to let me do the

10
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:43,880
talking, okay?

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,800
Should I be nervous about this?

12
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,949
Given your personality, your life experience, and

13
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,660
everything else you've done to make it

14
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,420
to this moment, yes.

15
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Jesse!

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
And Petra?

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,580
Hey, you all know Petra, my new super close friend.

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,500
We're super close now.

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,580
We ran into each other while I was looking for Ruben.

20
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,220
What were you doing in the woods, Petra?

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,148
Nothing, just drawn by the sound of Jesse's high-pitched

22
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:13,780
screams.

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,300
I would have been spider-bait if she hadn't found me.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,220
Sorry we didn't come with you, Jesse.

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
But hey, we won!

26
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,980
We did okay, didn't we?

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,594
I still wish I'd gotten that part in the back to look

28
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,140
better.

29
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,900
There could have been more fireworks in there, somewhere.
