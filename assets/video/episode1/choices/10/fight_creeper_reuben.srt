1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500
I don't wanna die!

3
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,000
Aaaaah!

4
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Burns, it burns!

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,100
Don’t you know? You dive INTO the water… you don’t land on top of it.

6
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
Pull yourself together, and follow me.

7
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,400
So, when we’re making the deal, I need you to let me do the talking, okay?

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,250
Should I be nervous about this?

9
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,690
Given your personality, your life experience, and everything else you've done to make it to this moment?

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,350
..Yes.

11
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,850
Jesse!

12
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,350
… and… Petra?

13
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,850
Hey, you all know Petra... my new super-close friend.

14
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,850
We're super-close now.

15
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,700
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,800
What were you doing in the woods, Petra?

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Nothing. Just… drawn by the sound of Jesse’s high-pitched screams.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,000
I would’ve been spider-bait if she hadn’t found me.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Sorry we didn’t come with you, Jesse.

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
But hey, we won!

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,100
We did okay, didn’t we?

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
I still wish I’d gotten that part in the back to look better…
