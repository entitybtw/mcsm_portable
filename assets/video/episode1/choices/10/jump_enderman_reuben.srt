1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let’s jump!

2
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,000
Aaaaah!

3
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Burns, it burns!

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,100
Don’t you know? You dive INTO the water… you don’t land on top of it.

5
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,200
Pull yourself together, and follow me.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,400
So, when we’re making the deal, I need you to let me do the talking, okay?

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,250
Should I be nervous about this?

8
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,690
Given your personality, your life experience, and everything else you've done to make it to this moment?

9
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,350
..Yes.

10
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,850
Jesse!

11
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,350
… and… Petra?

12
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,850
Hey, you all know Petra... my new super-close friend.

13
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,850
We're super-close now.

14
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,700
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,800
What were you doing in the woods, Petra?

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Nothing. Just… drawn by the sound of Jesse’s high-pitched screams.

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
I would’ve been spider-bait if she hadn’t found me.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,900
Sorry we didn’t come with you, Jesse.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
But hey, we won!

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,100
We did okay, didn’t we?

21
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,100
I still wish I’d gotten that part in the back to look better
