1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500
I don't wanna die!

3
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,000
Aaaaah!

4
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Burns, it burns!

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,100
Don’t you know? You dive INTO the water… you don’t land on top of it.

6
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
Pull yourself together, and follow me.

7
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Just let me know if you see Reuben anywhere.

8
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:41,522
He’s gotta be here somewhere.

9
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:43,650
I hope you’re right.

10
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,550
So, when we’re making the deal, I need you to let me do the talking, okay?

11
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,400
Should I be nervous about this?

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Given your personality, your life experience, and everything else you've done to make it to this moment?

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
..Yes.

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Jesse!

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,500
… and… Petra?

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, you all know Petra... my new super-close friend.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're super-close now.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,850
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

19
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,500
Couldn’t find him, huh?

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,850
He’ll turn up sooner or later -- I just know it!

21
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,500
I saw him, but before I knew what was happening, we were under attack by a zombie horde!

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I told him to run -- it was for his own good!

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Sorry we didn’t come with you, Jesse.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,000
But hey, we won!

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
We did okay, didn’t we?

26
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I still wish I’d gotten that part in the back to look better…
