1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't wanna die!

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,653
Don't you know you dive into the water you don't land on

4
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,880
top of it pull yourself together and follow me

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,931
Just let me know if you see Ruben anywhere, he's got to be

7
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:42,900
here somewhere. I hope you're right

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,381
So when we're making the deal I need you to let me do the

9
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,300
talking, okay

10
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,120
Should I be nervous about this?

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,602
Given your personality your life experience and everything

12
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,680
else you've done to make it to this moment

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,160
Yes

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Jesse and

15
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,074
Petra hey you all know Petra my new super close friend.

16
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,720
We're super close now

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,162
We ran into each other while I was looking for Ruben

18
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:14,400
couldn't find him, huh?

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,481
He'll turn up sooner or later. I just know it I saw him but

20
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,160
before I knew what was happening

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,157
We were under attack by a zombie horde. I told him to run

22
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:23,420
it was for his own good

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sorry, we didn't come with you Jesse, but hey we won

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
We

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,616
Did okay didn't we I still wish I'd gotten that part in the

26
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,040
back to look better I

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,880
Could have fit more fireworks in there somewhere
