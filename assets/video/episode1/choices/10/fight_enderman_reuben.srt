1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't wanna die!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come on!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Sveal it.

5
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,200
What a nice prayer.

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,900
Now all we got left is a rope and Khan.

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,760
Ban하는 침.

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,560
Thanks, wide.

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,180
He went into the earnest hole.

10
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:40,478
So, when we're making the deal, I need you to let me do the

11
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,860
talking, okay?

12
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,800
Should I be nervous about this?

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,949
Given your personality, your life experience, and

14
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,660
everything else you've done to make it

15
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,940
to this moment, yes.

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,540
Jesse.

17
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
Petra?

18
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,540
Hey, you all know Petra, my new super close friend.

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,440
We're super close now.

20
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,460
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,060
What were you doing in the woods, Petra?

22
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
Nothing, just drawn by the sound of Jesse's high-pitched

23
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,100
screams.

24
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,260
I would have been spider-bait if she hadn't found me.

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,140
Sorry we didn't come with you, Jesse.

26
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
But hey, we won!

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,980
We did okay, didn't we?

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,800
I still wish I'd gotten that part in the back to look

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,220
better.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,220
There could have been more fireworks in there, somewhere.
