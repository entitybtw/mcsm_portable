1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, let's jump!

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
AHHHHH!

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,202
Don't you know, you dive into the water, you don't land on

4
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:08,000
top of it.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pull yourself together and follow me.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just let me know if you see Ruben anywhere.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's gotta be here somewhere.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I hope you're right.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,189
So, when we're making the deal, I need you to let me do the

10
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:37,000
talking, okay?

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Should I be nervous about this?

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,311
Given your personality, your life experience, and

13
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,000
everything else you've done to make it to this moment...

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Jesse!

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And Petra?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, you all know Petra, my new super close friend.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We're super close now.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We ran into each other while I was looking for Ruben.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Couldn't find him, huh?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He'll turn up sooner or later, I just know it.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,545
I saw him, but before I knew what was happening, we were

23
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,000
under attack by a zombie horde.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I told him to run, it was for his own good.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sorry we didn't come with you, Jesse.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But hey, we won!

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We did okay, didn't we?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,606
I still wish I'd gotten that part in the back to look

29
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:24,000
better.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I could have fit more fireworks in there, somewhere.
