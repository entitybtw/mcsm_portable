00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The only way off this bridge is through them.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't wanna die!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello people!

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome back!

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The super duper long bridge in Ganya.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,029

I love the other sections

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Have a good day!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,840
Don't you know?

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,640
You dive into the water.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
You don't land on top of it.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:38,000
Pull yourself together and follow me.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,280
Just let me know if you see Ruben anywhere.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,920
He's got to be here somewhere.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
I hope you're right.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,345
So when we're making the deal, I need you to let me do the

21
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:48,920
talking.

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,840
Okay?

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Should I be nervous about this?

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,218
Given your personality, your life experience, and

25
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:57,080
everything else you've done to make it

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,320
to this moment, yes.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
Jesse.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,600
And Petra?

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,480
Hey, you all know Petra, my new super close friend.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
We're super close now.

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,320
We ran into each other while I was looking for Ruben.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,720
Couldn't find him, huh?

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,120
He'll turn up sooner or later.

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
I just know it.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
I saw him, but before I knew what was happening,

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,800
we were under attack by a zombie horde.

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
I told him to run.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,160
It was for his own good.

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,040
Sorry we didn't come with you, Jesse.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,960
But hey, we won.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,000
We did okay, didn't we?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,691
I still wish I'd gotten that part in the back to look

43
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,400
better.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,000
I could have fit more fireworks in there somewhere.
