1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let’s jump!

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,500
Aaaaah!

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Burns, it burns!

4
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,600
Don’t you know? You dive INTO the water… you don’t land on top of it.

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,700
Pull yourself together, and follow me.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Just let me know if you see Reuben anywhere.

7
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,022
He’s gotta be here somewhere.

8
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,150
I hope you’re right.

9
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,050
So, when we’re making the deal, I need you to let me do the talking, okay?

10
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,900
Should I be nervous about this?

11
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,340
Given your personality, your life experience, and everything else you've done to make it to this moment?

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
..Yes.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Jesse!

14
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,000
… and… Petra?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
Hey, you all know Petra... my new super-close friend.

16
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
We're super-close now.

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,350
We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben.

18
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,000
Couldn’t find him, huh?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,350
He’ll turn up sooner or later -- I just know it!

20
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,000
I saw him, but before I knew what was happening, we were under attack by a zombie horde!

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I told him to run -- it was for his own good!

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sorry we didn’t come with you, Jesse.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,500
But hey, we won!

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
We did okay, didn’t we?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I still wish I’d gotten that part in the back to look better…
