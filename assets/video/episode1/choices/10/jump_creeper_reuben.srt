1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, let's jump!

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,686
Don't you know you dive into the water you don't land on

3
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,880
top of it

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Pull yourself together and follow me

5
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,877
So when we're making the deal I need you to let me do the

6
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:30,800
talking, okay

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,920
Should I be nervous about this?

8
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,339
Given your personality your life experience and everything

9
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:39,400
else you've done to make it to this moment

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,160
Yes

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Jesse and

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,091
Petra hey you all know Petra my new super close friend.

13
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,840
We're super close now

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,435
We ran into each other while I was looking for Ruben. What

15
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:58,080
were you doing in the woods Petra? Nothing just

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,554
Drawn by the sound of Jesse's high-pitched screams. I would

17
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,900
have been spider-bate if she hadn't found me

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,320
Sorry, we didn't come with you Jesse, but hey we won

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,411
We did okay, didn't we I still wish I'd gotten that part in

20
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,880
the back to look better

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,080
There could have been more fireworks in there somewhere
