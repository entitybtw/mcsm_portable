1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Everybody hold on!

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Oh no!

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Fuck!

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Watch it!

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,400
Okay, so...

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
We're not the only ones seeing that we're running out of

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,400
track, right?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
No!

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,700
Good!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Jesse! That switch! Now, do it!

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Hold on, don't fail me now!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wow!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,809
I thought something bad was gonna happen there, but I guess

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,000
everything's gonna be...

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whoa!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, wait!

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Uh, Axel?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Lydia?

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Ruben?

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Anybody?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hang on, Ruben!

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ruben?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,027
Okay, Ruben, remember how I said everything was gonna be

24
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,000
just fine before?

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I know I was wrong then, but...

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Whoa!

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop!

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Whoa!

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, gasser officially crossed off my to-see list.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Some of the gas, you never need to see them.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Are you freaking kidding me with that?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Spin, spin, spin...

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh!

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is... huh... is everyone okay?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I mean, I'm not dead. I guess that's pretty good.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ditto. Ditto with the not dead.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,803
I just can't believe that Petra comes down here all the

38
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:19,000
time.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This place is awful.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your throat's gonna be sore later, Axel.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why?

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just saying.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Wasn't that you doing all that screaming before?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sounded like you were really shredding your larynx.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, yeah! I heard that too.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really high-pitched, kind of like a squeaky piston.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What? No, shut up.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Never mind. Must've... must've been something else.
