1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here we go!

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Oh, no.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Watch it!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,150
Okay, so, I'm not the only one seeing that we're running out of track, right?

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,150
No!

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,500
Good!

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Jesse! That switch! Now! Do it!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,250
Ooh, arms don't fail me now...

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,500
Haha, wow. I thought something bad was going to happen there, but, heh, I guess everything's going to be...

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Whoa!

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Whoa! Wait!

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh man!

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Uhhhhhhh, Axel? Olivia? Reuben? Anybody?!

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Hang on, Reuben!

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Reuben!!

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay Reuben, remember when I everything was going to be just fine before?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I know I was wrong THEN but...

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Whoa!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Stop!

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, Ghasts are OFFICIALLY crossed off my to-see list.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Done with the Ghasts. Never need to see them...

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,750
Are you freaking kidding me with this?

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
This-is-bad, this-is-bad, this-is-bad.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Is...Ha... Is everyone okay?

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I mean I'm not dead. I guess that's pretty good.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,750
Ditto. Ditto with the not dead.

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,541
I just can't believe that Petra comes down here all the time... This place is awful.
