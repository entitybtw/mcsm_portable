1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here we go!

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Good job!

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Oh no!

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Watch it!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,950
Okay, so... but that's the only one seen that we're running

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,000
out of track, right?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Good!

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Jesse, that switch! Now, do it!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Don't fail me now!

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,758
Wow! I thought something bad was gonna happen there, but I

12
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,500
guess everything's gonna be...

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Whoa!

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Whoa, wait!

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh man!

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Uh, Axel? Olivia? Reuben? Anybody?

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Hang on, Reuben!

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Reuben!

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,022
Okay, remember how I said everything was gonna be just fine

20
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:13,500
before?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I know I was wrong then, but...

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Whoa!

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Stop!

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Whoa!

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Well, gasser officially crossed off my to-see list.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Some of the glass, you never need to see them.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Are you freaking kidding me with this?

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Span, span, span...

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Is... huh... is everyone okay?

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I mean, I'm not dead. I guess that's pretty good.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Ditto. Ditto. The not dead.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,853
I just can't believe that Petra comes down here all the

33
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,500
time. This place is awful.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Heh. Your throat's gonna be sore later, Axel.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Why?

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,130
I'm just saying. Wasn't that you doing all that screaming

37
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,500
before?

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Sounded like you were gonna die.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm not dead.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Why?

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,130
I'm just saying. Wasn't that you doing all that screaming

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,500
before?

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Sounded like you were really shredding your larynx.

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Oh, yeah. I heard that too.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Really high-pitched, kind of like a squeaky piston.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
What? No, shut up.

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Never mind. Must've... must've been something else.
