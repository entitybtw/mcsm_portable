1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
She's going to make it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
You're concerned about your friend. It's admirable.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
You're all going to be dead, very soon.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll see about that.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,500
You don't even realize... you're in danger -- right now.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
So are you.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Through that tunnel is a network of mine carts built by the Order of the Stone.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,250
It's your only way out.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,250
Much as I hate to admit, he might be right.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,250
Bravo for embracing the truth.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,750
What was that?

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,000
I would wish you good luck, but luck won't carry you through the Nether.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,250
You have my sympathies.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,500
Let's get out of here!

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
RUN!

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,500
This must be what Ivor was talking about.

17
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,500
Everybody, hold on!

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,875
Wow.

19
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,250
The Nether.

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,950
Yeah... That is a LOT of lava.

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,450
And fire.

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,750
And other things that could burn you to death.

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
Oh no!

24
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,750
Oh that's a drop. That is very, very much a drop.

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,750
What are you talking about, new guy?

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,750
What drrrr

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,750
Oh! You weren't kidding.
