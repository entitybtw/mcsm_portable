00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our friend is in trouble because of you. 

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're trapped in the Nether because of you!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,750
You have much bigger problems to contend with.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,250
Through that tunnel is a network of mine carts built by the Order of the Stone.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,500
It's your only way out.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Much as I hate to admit, he might be right.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Bravo for embracing the truth.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What was that?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,250
I would wish you good luck, but luck won't carry you through the Nether.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,500
You have my sympathies.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,750
Let's get out of here!

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,750
RUN!

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,750
This must be what Ivor was talking about.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,750
Everybody, hold on!

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,125
Wow.

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,500
The Nether.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,200
Yeah... That is a LOT of lava.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,700
And fire.

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,000
And other things that could burn you to death.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh no!

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh that's a drop. That is very, very much a drop.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you talking about, new guy?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What drrrr

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh! You weren't kidding.
