1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,260
What did you see?

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
Leave her alone!

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,880
Yeah, back off pal.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,160
You two!

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,200
Did you follow me here?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,640
You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
We're here to prove you wrong.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,280
What are you going to do about it?

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,720
We know what you're doing down here.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,200
Soul sand and three wither skulls?

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,720
You're building a wither!

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Smarter than you look.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Hey, nobody talks to my friends like that.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,960
Now shut your mouth or else.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Enough!

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,720
You've wasted too much of my time already.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Where'd he go?

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,456
If you won't leave of your own volition, I'll happily

20
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:47,720
remove you myself.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:01:06,720
So I'll raise the door, will you?

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh man, this is so exciting.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,877
And now, for the first time ever here at EnderCon, we are

24
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:35,280
very proud to present...

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
The one, the only...

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Please, please.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
Thank you.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Are you with me?

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Yes!

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Anybody okay?

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Um, guys?

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:02:09,720
I thought he was right behind me.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,880
Well, if he's not here, the only place he could be is...

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
He's still down there!

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,026
Ivor's got an iron golem and all the ingredients to build a

36
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,040
wither down there.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,329
If he were to unleash it in this crowd of people, we have

38
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,080
to act fast.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,402
It just so happens that the greatest warrior of all time is

40
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:27,360
in the building.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,800
We should ask Gabriel for help.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,040
This is the smartest way to help Lucas.

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
He's tough.

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,130
I just hope he's tough enough to hold out a little bit

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,440
longer.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.
