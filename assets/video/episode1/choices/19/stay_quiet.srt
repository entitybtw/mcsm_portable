1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What are you doing here?! 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,700
What did you see?!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,000
Leave him alone!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah! Back off, pal.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
You two?! Did you follow me here?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're here to prove you wrong.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are you going to do about it?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We know what you're doing here. Soul sand and three wither skulls? You're building a Wither!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hmph. Smarter than you look.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,600
Hey! Nobody talks to my friends like that! Now shut you mouth -- or else.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,500
Enough! You've wasted too much of my time already.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Where'd he go?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,500
If you won't leave of your own volition, I'll happily remove you myself!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,250
Show our friends the door, will you?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Oh man, this is so exciting.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,500
It’s true, isn’t it?

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,500
And now, for the first time ever here at Endercon! We are very proud to present --

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
The one! The only!

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Gabriel!!

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Please. Please. Thank you.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are. You. With me?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everybody okay?

24
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,400
Um... guys? 

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,250
Where's Lukas?

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,700
I thought he was right behind me.

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, if he's not here, the only place he could be is --

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's still down there!

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Ivor's got an iron golem and all the ingredients to build a Wither down there.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
If he were to unleash it in this crowd of people... We have to act fast.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,500
It just so happens that the greatest warrior of all time is in the building.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
We should ask Gabriel for help!
