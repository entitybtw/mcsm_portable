00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Olivia, look out!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What are you doing here?! 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,700
What did you see?!

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,000
Leave him alone!

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah! Back off, pal.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,600
You two?! Did you follow me here?

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're here to prove you wrong.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What are you going to do about it?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We know what you're doing here. Soul sand and three wither skulls? You're building a Wither!

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hmph. Smarter than you look.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Hey! Nobody talks to my friends like that! Now shut you mouth -- or else.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,500
Enough! You've wasted too much of my time already.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Where'd he go?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,500
If you won't leave of your own volition, I'll happily remove you myself!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,250
Show our friends the door, will you?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh man, this is so exciting.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,500
It’s true, isn’t it?

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:26,500
And now, for the first time ever here at Endercon! We are very proud to present --

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
The one! The only!

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Gabriel!!

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Please. Please. Thank you.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are. You. With me?

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Everybody okay?

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,400
Um... guys? 

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,250
Where's Lukas?

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,700
I thought he was right behind me.

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, if he's not here, the only place he could be is --

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's still down there!

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Ivor's got an iron golem and all the ingredients to build a Wither down there.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,000
If he were to unleash it in this crowd of people... We have to act fast.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
It just so happens that the greatest warrior of all time is in the building.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
We should ask Gabriel for help!
