1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Olivia, look out!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What did you see?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Leave him alone!

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, back off, pal.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You two! Did you follow me here?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're here to prove you wrong.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What are you going to do about it?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We know what you're doing down here.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Soul sand and three wither skulls? You're building a wither!

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hmph. Smarter than you look.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hey, nobody talks to my friends like that.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now shut your mouth, or else.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Enough! You've wasted too much of my time already.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Where'd he go?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,515
If you leave of your own volition, I'll happily remove you

18
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:46,000
myself.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come on, friends, the tour, will you?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, man, this is so exciting.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It sure is.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And now, for the first time ever here at EnderCon,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we are very proud to present...

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Web.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Web.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Web.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The Web.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The Web.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The Web.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The Web.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Web.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Web.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Web.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Web.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please, please.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you with me?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To the end!

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Anybody okay?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Um, guys?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where's Lukas?

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I thought he was right behind me.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, if he's not here, the only place he could be is...

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's still down there!

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,269
Ivor's got an iron golem and all the ingredients to build a

46
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:09,000
wither down there.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,257
If he were to unleash it on this crowd of people, we have

48
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,000
to act fast.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,105
It just so happens that the greatest warrior of all time is

50
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,000
in the building.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We should ask Gabriel for help.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is the smartest way to help Lukas.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He's tough.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,612
I just hope he's tough enough to hold out a little bit

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,000
longer.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
...exploits of the Order of the Stalled, and even I do.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But then, it's so easy to doubt ourselves, isn't it?

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,569
It's easy to tell ourselves we can't do the things we want

59
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:37,000
to do.
