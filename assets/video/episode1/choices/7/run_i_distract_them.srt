1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You’re gonna have to make a run for it, okay?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
I’ll meet up with you back in town, I promise!

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Get outta here! Now!

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Get off of me!

5
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,067
Come on, let’s get out of the open.

6
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,300
I wanna show you something.

7
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:58,550
Not this isn’t a cool, dimly lit tunnel, but… how far away is this thing you want to show me?

8
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,100
Careful, Jesse. You don’t want to get a reputation as a wimp.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,065
This isn’t my first time in a cave, Petra.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,568
Yeah, but have you ever seen… A witherskull?

11
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,800
Woah!

12
0:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,438
Fresh from the Nether.

13
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,350
That’s insane, Petra. You could’ve gotten yourself killed.

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,450
Don’t worry so much. I can handle myself.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,117
There’s this guy I’m meeting up with at Endercon… he’s gonna trade me a diamond for it.

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,300
Why didn’t he just go get the skull himself?

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,500
He’s not the kind of guy who has time to do something like that!

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,091
What kind of guy is he, then?

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,128
The kind who understands the value of hard work.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Wow.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,800
Wow… what?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,300
In a single day, you went to the Nether, you killed a Wither skeleton…

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,200
I mean, I DID build a super cool statue, but still. It’s pretty sweet being you, huh?

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,300
You know… you could come with me.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,752
I mean, if you’re too nervous, I totally get it.
