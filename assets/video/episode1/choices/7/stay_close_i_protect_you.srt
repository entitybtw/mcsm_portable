1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
There’s too many of them, buddy.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Don’t leave that spot, no matter what. You hear me?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I’ve got you!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Get away from him!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh no! He got you!

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Get off of me!

8
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,467
Come on, let’s get out of the open.

9
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:58,700
I wanna show you something.

10
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:06,950
Not this isn’t a cool, dimly lit tunnel, but… how far away is this thing you want to show me?

11
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,500
Careful, Jesse. You don’t want to get a reputation as a wimp.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,465
This isn’t my first time in a cave, Petra.

13
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:15,968
Yeah, but have you ever seen… a Witherskull?

14
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,200
Woah!

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,838
Fresh from the Nether.

16
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,750
That’s insane, Petra. You could’ve gotten yourself killed.

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,850
Don’t worry so much. I can handle myself.

18
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,467
There’s this guy I’m meeting up with at Endercon… he’s gonna trade me a diamond for it.

19
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,650
Why didn’t he just go get the skull himself?

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,850
He’s not the kind of guy who has time to do something like that!

21
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,441
What kind of guy is he, then?

22
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,478
The kind who understands the value of hard work.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
Wow.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Wow… what?

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,700
In a single day, you went to the Nether, you killed a Wither skeleton…

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,600
I mean, I DID build a super cool statue, but still. It’s pretty sweet being you, huh?

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,700
You know… you could come with me.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,152
I mean, if you’re too nervous, I totally get it.
