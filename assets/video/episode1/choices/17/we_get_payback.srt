1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,331
I wouldn't mind a little payback. He deserves it for

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:07,080
crossing Petra. You ready? Ready

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,900
You see anything? He must have gone out another way

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,003
What is all this? Looks like it used to be the basement, a

5
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,360
weird place to have a hideout

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,664
I bet you anything I'll find my wither skull here. And if

7
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,674
we find anything else cool to steal along the way, so be

8
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:35,320
it, right?

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Axel, that's not what we're here to do. I

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,009
Did say we wanted payback. No better paybacks than thieving

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,180
from a thief, right?

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,983
Let's focus on finding the skull not stealing. Nobody ever

13
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,360
lets me have any fun

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,434
We let you hang out with us. The faster we find what we're

15
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,160
looking for the faster we can get the heck out of here

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Oh

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Hello

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Too heavy and too soft but super flashy

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
You're keeping it but I thought it was too soft too heavy

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,440
It still might come in handy and it is super flashy

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,360
Hey, you still have that one stone sword, right? Now I had

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,440
to give it to some jerk Watt butcher to save Reuben's life

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Geez. Oh, well, I guess that was a pretty good cause here

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Thanks again, you're welcome. Don't lose that one

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,038
Find anything I want to steal that and that I just want to

26
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:46,880
touch that

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,774
Boo take a look at this you're not gonna believe me, but I

28
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,920
swear I had a dream about this

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay potion. I know this is a big step but I

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Would be honored if you'd come home with me
