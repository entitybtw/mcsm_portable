1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We politely ask for what's ours.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Short, sweet, and to the point.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Not bad.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You ready?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ready.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You see anything?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He must have gone out another way.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is all this?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Looks like it used to be the basement.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A place to have a hideout.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I bet you anything I'll find my wither skull here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,081
And if we find anything else cool to steal along the way,

13
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,000
so be it, right?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Axel, that's not what we're here to do.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I said we should ask politely, Axel.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, but if the guy's not here, we can't ask.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I say, we take.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's focus on finding the skull, not stealing.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Nobody ever lets me have any fun.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We let you hang out with us.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,604
The faster we find what we're looking for, the faster we

22
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:01,000
can get the heck out of here.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, hello.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Too heavy, and too soft.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But super flashy.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're keeping it?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But I thought it was too soft, too heavy.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Eh, it still might come in handy.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it is super flashy.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, you still have that one stone sword, right?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,176
Nah, I had to give it to some jerk Wad Butcher to save

32
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,000
Reuben's life.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Geez. Oh well. I guess that was a pretty good cause.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thanks. Again.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're welcome. Don't lose that one.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Find anything?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I wanna steal that, and that.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just wanna touch that.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Boo, take a look at this.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,090
You're not gonna believe me, but I swear I had a dream

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,000
about this.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, potion. I know this is a big step, but...

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I would be honored if you'd come home with me.
