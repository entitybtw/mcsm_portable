1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,700
Thank you, Jesse! Now get through the portal!

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Jesse!!!

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Just hold on, Petra! i'm coming for you!!

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,080
Where's Petra?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,960
We did everything we could

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,650
What are you saying?

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,400
It was chaos. There wasn't much I could do.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,680
Jesse's right.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
Petra is still up there.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,960
I got scared. Just for a second.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,840
You got scared?

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,400
It wasn't my fault.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,160
You got scared and it's not your fault?!

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,000
Back off, Axel.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,220
We should go back.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,960
She just needs more time.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
Petra needs our help. We're going.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,360
Hey! There she is!

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,860
Come on... come on!

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,860
You again.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,800
Ivor.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,400
You ruined everything!

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,900
You can't blame us! Your plan, your monster, your fault.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,600
Maybe... but if you hadn't stolen from me, I would have destroyed it.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
And all of those people... would have been saved.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,500
There's nothing left up there! Nothing but that Wither storm.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,600
Why are we wasting time talking to this jerk? We have to go and get Petra.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
The girl. I saw her.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,500
What?

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,950
While I was running toward the portal I passed her.

31
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,800
She was running in the opposite direction.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,300
Such bravery.

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,302
Of course, there's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
