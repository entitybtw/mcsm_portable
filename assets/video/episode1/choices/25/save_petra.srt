00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Thanks Jesse!

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,500
Gabriel's still up there!

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Jesse!! Go!!!

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
No!

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,220
Where's Petra?

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,100
We did everything we could

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,790
What are you saying?

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,540
It was chaos. There wasn't much I could do.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,820
Jesse's right.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,580
Petra is still up there.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,100
I got scared. Just for a second.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,980
You got scared?

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,540
It wasn't my fault.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,300
You got scared and it's not your fault?!

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,140
Back off, Axel.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,360
We should go back.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,100
She just needs more time.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,300
Petra needs our help. We're going.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,500
Hey! There she is!

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Come on... come on!

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You again.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,940
Ivor.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,540
You ruined everything!

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,040
You can't blame us! Your plan, your monster, your fault.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,740
Maybe... but if you hadn't stolen from me, I would have destroyed it.

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,740
And all of those people... would have been saved.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,640
There's nothing left up there! Nothing but that Wither storm.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,740
Why are we wasting time talking to this jerk? We have to go and get Petra.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,940
The girl. I saw her.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,640
What?

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,090
While I was running toward the portal I passed her.

32
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,940
She was running in the opposite direction.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,440
Such bravery.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,442
Of course, there's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
