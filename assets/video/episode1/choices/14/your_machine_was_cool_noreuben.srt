1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your beacon wasn't too shabby.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You don't have to do that, okay?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You guys won fair and square.

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:11,666
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with a long hair and a beard roaming around, did you?

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,166
I don't think so... why?

6
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,666
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:19,266
Whoa -- everyone knows, you don't mess with Petra.

8
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,266
Not if you know what's good for you.

9
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,266
I'll keep a eye out, okay?

10
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,766
Thanks, I appreciate it

11
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:28,166
So, uh, we're cool?

12
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,066
Yeah, we're cool.

13
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,066
Cool, cool.

14
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,566
Ha! See you later, Lukas.

15
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,066
Yeah. See ya.

16
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,566
Thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap, didn't you?

17
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:46,466
Well -- Wiggle as much as you want -- you're not goin' anywhere

18
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:51,366
Axel, listen up -- any chance you've seen a creepy-looking beard-y guy anywhere?

19
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:56,066
No, but Petra told me what happened -- I'm keeping an eye out for him.

20
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,628
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

21
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:07,566
It's just this machine presses all my buttons -- unnecessarily complicated, and mean to birds for no reason.

22
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,566
Stop messing around -- we need your help

23
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:14,066
I was looking, I swear -- I've just got a short attention span.

24
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:18,566
Have you seen Reuben? I was hoping he might've made it to town while I was distracted.

25
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:23,566
Haven't seen hide nor hair. But I'm sure he's fine. He's a tough little ham.

26
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,220
Axel?

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,066
All right, all right. I'll look.

28
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,627
After I watch one more chicken get owned.

29
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,566
Ha! I see you now, weirdo...

30
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,566
Well, if it isn't Team Trashbag! How's your stupid pig?

31
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,066
I'm busy right now, man.

32
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:56,066
What? Busy trying to get a life? Busy trying to find some friends?

33
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,066
Hey!

34
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,057
Hey! Where do you think you're --

35
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,124
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,192
Oh, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,660
Get away from me!

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,295
I said I was sorry.

39
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,434
Reuben? Is that you?!

40
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:20,140
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop!

41
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:22,110
Reuben!

42
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:27,247
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

43
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,150
That's my pig! You kidnapped my pig!

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,622
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief. I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

45
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,157
Please. He's my friend.

46
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,759
To me, he's inventory.

47
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,096
I might be amenable to some kind of trade...

48
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:49,937
Not that you look like you've got much of value. I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.
