1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your beacon wasn't too shabby.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You don't have to do that, okay?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You guys won fair and square.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,031
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with long hair

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,000
and a beard roaming around, did you?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't think so. Why?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Whoa. Everyone knows you don't mess with Petra.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Not if you know what's good for you.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll keep an eye out, okay?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thanks, I appreciate it.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, uh, we're cool?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, we're cool.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Cool, cool.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
See you later, Lucas.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, see ya.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,462
I thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap,

18
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,000
didn't you?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, wiggle as much as you want.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're not going anywhere.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,653
Axel, listen up. Any chance you've seen a creepy-looking,

22
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,000
beardy guy anywhere?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No. Petra told me what happened.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm keeping an eye out for him.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's just this machine presses all my buttons.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Unnecessarily complicated, mean to birds for no reason.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop messing around. We need your help.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was looking, I swear.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I just got a short attention span.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, alright, I'll look.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After I watch one more chicken ghetto.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I see you now, weirdo.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wow, if it isn't Team Trash Bat.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How's your stupid pig?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm busy right now, man.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What, busy trying to get a life?

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Busy trying to find some friends?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, what do you think you're...

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you think you're doing?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Get away from me.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I said I was sorry.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ruben, is that you?

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ruben!

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's my pig you kidnapped my pig.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please, he's my friend.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To me, he's inventory.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I might be amenable to some kind of trade.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not that you look like you got much of value.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Otherwise, it's straight to the slaughterhouse for this one.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You
