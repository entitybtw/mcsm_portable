1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You know, that stunt your friend pulled really hurt my pig.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay, maybe, but I had nothing to do with that.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with a long hair and a beard roaming around, did you?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
I don't think so... why?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Whoa -- everyone knows, you don't mess with Petra.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Not if you know what's good for you.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I'll keep a eye out, okay?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Thanks, I appreciate it

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
So, uh, we're cool?

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah, we're cool.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Cool, cool.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,700
Ha! See you later, Lukas.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Yeah. See ya.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap, didn't you?

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Well -- Wiggle as much as you want -- you're not goin' anywhere

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,500
Axel, listen up -- any chance you've seen a creepy-looking beard-y guy anywhere?

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,200
No, but Petra told me what happened -- I'm keeping an eye out for him.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,762
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

20
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:08,700
It's just this machine presses all my buttons -- unnecessarily complicated, and mean to birds for no reason.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Stop messing around -- we need your help

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,200
I was looking, I swear -- I've just got a short attention span.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,700
Have you seen Reuben? I was hoping he might've made it to town while I was distracted.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Haven't seen hide nor hair. But I'm sure he's fine. He's a tough little ham.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,354
Axel?

26
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,200
All right, all right. I'll look.

27
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,761
After I watch one more chicken get owned.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Ha! I see you now, weirdo...

29
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,700
Well, if it isn't Team Trashbag! How's your stupid pig?

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm busy right now, man.

31
0:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
What? Busy trying to get a life? Busy trying to find some friends?

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey!

33
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,191
Hey! Where do you think you're --

34
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,258
What do you think you're doing?

35
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,326
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,794
Get away from me!

37
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,429
I said I was sorry.

38
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,568
Reuben? Is that you?!

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,274
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop!

40
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,244
Reuben!

41
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:28,281
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

42
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,284
That's my pig! You kidnapped my pig!

43
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:36,756
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief. I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

44
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,291
Please. He's my friend.

45
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,893
To me, he's inventory.

46
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,230
I might be amenable to some kind of trade...

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:51,071
Not that you look like you've got much of value. I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.
