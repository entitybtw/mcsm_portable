1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You know, that stunt your friend pulled really hurt my pig.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay, maybe, but I had nothing to do with that.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,556
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with long hair

4
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:12,800
and a beard roaming around, did you?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
I don't think so. Why?

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Whoa, everyone knows you don't mess with Petra.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Not if you know what's good for you.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I'll keep an eye out, okay?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Thanks, I appreciate it.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
So, uh, we're cool?

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah, we're cool.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Cool, cool.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,700
Ha! See you later, Lucas.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Yeah, see ya.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,162
I thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap,

17
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:42,700
didn't you?

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Well, wiggle as much as you want. You're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,261
Axel, listen up. Any chance you've seen a...

20
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:52,500
creepy-looking, beardy guy anywhere?

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,832
No. Petra told me what happened. I'm keeping an eye out for

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,200
him.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,443
Okay, so I got a little distracted. It's just this machine

24
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:04,200
presses all my buttons.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,700
Unnecessarily complicated, mean to birds for no reason.

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Stop messing around. We need your help.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,757
I was looking, I swear. I've just got a short attention

28
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:15,200
span.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Have you seen Ruben? I was hoping he might have made it to

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,700
town while I was distracted.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,134
Haven't seen hide nor hair. But I'm sure he's fine. He's a

32
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:24,200
tough little ham.

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Axel?

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
All right, all right, I'll look.

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,700
After I watch one more chicken get over.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Ha! I see you now, weirdo.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Wow! If it isn't Team Trashback. How's your stupid pig?

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm busy right now, man.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,518
What, busy trying to get a life? Busy trying to find some

40
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:57,200
friends?

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey!

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Hey, what do you think you're...

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,700
What do you think you're doing?

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Get away from me!

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I said I was sorry.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Ruben? Is that you?

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,700
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop.

49
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Ruben!

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,700
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
That's my pig. You kidnapped my pig.

52
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief.

53
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,200
I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Please, he's my friend.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
To me, he's inventory.

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
I might be amenable to some kind of trade.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Not that you look like you've got much of value.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Otherwise, it's straight to the slaughterhouse for this one.
