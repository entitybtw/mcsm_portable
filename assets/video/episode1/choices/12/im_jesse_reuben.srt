00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
The name's Jesse. What's it to you?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm supposed to meet up with Petra, not whoever you're supposed to be!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't walk out of here right now!

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,714
You're the guy who needed a Wither skull , right?

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,114
Not so loud, you idiot!

6
00:00:16,114--> 00:00:19,000
Too many people know my business already.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Do you have the skull?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Uh... well… Petra has it -- and she'll be back any minute now!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,214
Well. As long as she's bringing it... I suppose it wouldn't kill me to wait a minute longer.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Uh... well…

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Ivor!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
Ah, here she is!

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Sorry I'm late, but -- good things are worth waiting for. I've got what you asked for.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
IF you have what you promised us.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You didn't say anything about "us" when we first met.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I don't like surprises.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If these are the people you associate with…

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
perhaps we should call the whole thing off

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My friend is fine, right, Jesse? There's no problem here
