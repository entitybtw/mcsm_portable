1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No, who are YOU?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,306
If you belonged here, you would know!

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,000
Unless that's all part of the plan…

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,371
I'm supposed to meet up with Petra, not whoever you're supposed to be!

5
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,771
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't walk out of here right now!

6
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:18,085
You're the guy who needed a Wither skull , right?

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,485
Not so loud, you idiot!

8
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:23,371
Too many people know my business already.

9
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,371
Do you have the skull?

10
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:30,371
Uh... well… Petra has it -- and she'll be back any minute now!

11
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:36,585
Well. As long as she's bringing it... I suppose it wouldn't kill me to wait a minute longer.

12
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:41,371
Uh... well…

13
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,371
Ivor!

14
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,871
Ah, here she is!

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:52,871
Sorry I'm late, but -- good things are worth waiting for. I've got what you asked for.

16
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,371
IF you have what you promised us.

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,371
You didn't say anything about "us" when we first met.

18
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,371
And I don't like surprises.

19
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:04,371
If these are the people you associate with…

20
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:07,371
perhaps we should call the whole thing off

21
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,371
My friend is fine, right, Jesse? There's no problem here
