1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No, who are you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you belonged here, you wouldn't know.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Unless that's all part of the plan?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,294
I'm supposed to meet with Petra, not whatever you're

5
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:10,000
supposed to be.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,343
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't walk out of here

7
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:14,000
right now.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're the guy who needed a wither skull, right?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Not so loud, you idiot.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Too many people know my business already.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you have the skull?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Uh, well, Petra has it.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Should we be back any minute now?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, as long as she's bringing it.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I suppose it wouldn't kill me to wait a minute longer.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Uh, well...

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ivor!

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ah, here she is.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Sorry I'm late, but good things are worth waiting for.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I've got what you asked for.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you have what you promised us...

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You didn't say anything about an us when we first met.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I don't like surprises.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If these are the sorts of people you associate with,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
perhaps we should call the whole thing off.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My friend is fine, right, Jesse?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There's no problem here.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's not be too hasty, okay?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is just a little misunderstanding.
