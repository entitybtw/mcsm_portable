1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The name's Jesse. What's it to you?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,058
I'm supposed to meet with Petra, not whatever you're

3
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:07,000
supposed to be.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,507
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't walk out of here

5
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:10,000
right now!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're the guy who needed a wither skull, right?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Not so loud, you idiot!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Too many people know my business already.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Do you have the skull?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, well... Petra has it. Should we back any minute now?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,800
Well, as long as she's bringing it. I suppose it wouldn't

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
kill me to wait a minute longer.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Uh, well...

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ivor!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ah, here she is.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,554
Sorry I'm late, but good things are worth waiting for. I've

17
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:48,000
got what you asked for.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you have what you promised us...

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You didn't say anything about an us when we first met?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I don't like surprises.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If these are the sorts of people you associate with...

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Perhaps we should call the whole thing off!

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My friend is fine, right Jesse? There's no problem here.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's not be too hasty, okay?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is just a little misunderstanding.
