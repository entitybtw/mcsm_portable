00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
I'm proud of you guys. Oh shucks. Don't make me blush

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,693
Seriously, don't hey Jesse. It's time to go see about that

3
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:12,220
thing

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, right the thing subtle. Yeah as a punch to the face

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,589
Axel and I were gonna head into Ender Khan anyway, see you

6
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,338
in there. I heard somebody saying there's free cake by the

7
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:23,860
map booth

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,620
Hurry we're supposed to meet in the alley over there

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,740
Dark dark very dark in here

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,944
That's weird. He said the dark creepy alley close to the

11
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,920
gates, but he's not here

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,116
Maybe he's late. Are you sure this is the dark creepy alley

13
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:45,760
he meant?

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Hmm. I was

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,091
Okay, new plan you stay here just in case this is this body

16
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,000
meant and I'll look around

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,426
Okay, I'll hold down the fort thanks Jesse, I'll be back

18
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,784
before you know it if he shows up while I'm gone just stall

19
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:02,240
for me

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
And just who are you

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,280

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
