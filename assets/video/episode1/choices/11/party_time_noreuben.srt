1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We deserve a victory party. Who's in?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,731
I like all kinds of parties, but especially ones where I

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,000
get to celebrate winning.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
About time we'll be the guest of honor at something.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, Jesse, it's time to go see about that... thing.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, right, the thing.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's subtle.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,118
It has a punch to the face. Axel and I are gonna head into

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,000
Endercon anyway. See you in there?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I heard somebody saying there's free cake by the map booth.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hurry. We're supposed to meet in the alley over there.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dark, dark, very dark in here.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,560
That's weird. He said the dark, creepy alley close to the

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,000
gates, but he's not here. Maybe he's late.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you sure this is the dark, creepy alley he meant?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hmm. I was.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,302
Is? Okay, new plan. You stay here, just in case this is the

19
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:57,000
spot he meant, and I'll look around.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,041
Thanks, Jesse. I'll be back before you know it. If he shows

22
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,000
up while I'm gone, just stall for me.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And just who are you?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm waiting.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Answer me!
