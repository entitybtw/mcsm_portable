00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
I’m proud of you guys.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,250
Aw, shucks.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,500
Don’t make me blush. Seriously. Don’t.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Hey, Jesse. It’s time to go see about that -- thing.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Oh, right, The “thing”.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,500
Subtle.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As a punch to the face. Axel and I were gonna head into Endercon anyway -- see you in there?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
I heard somebody saying there’s free cake by the map booth.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Hurry -- we’re supposed to meet in the alley over there.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Dark. Dark. Very dark in here.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,200
That's weird -- he said the dark, creepy alleyway close to the gates, but he's not here. Maybe he's late.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you sure THIS is the dark, creepy alleyway he was talking about?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
Hmm. I WAS.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,500
Okay, new plan. You stay here just in case this IS the spot he meant, and I'll look around.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Thanks, Jesse. I'll be back before you know it. If he shows up while I'm gone, just stall for me.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And just who are YOU?
