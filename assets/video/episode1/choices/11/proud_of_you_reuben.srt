00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm proud of you guys.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Aw, shucks.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Don't make me blush.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Seriously. Don't.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, Jesse. It's time to go see about that... thing.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, right. The thing.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's subtle.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It has a punch to the face.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Axel and I were gonna head into Endercon anyway.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
See you in there?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I heard somebody saying there's free cake by the map booth.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hurry. We're supposed to meet in the alley over there.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Dark. Dark. Very dark in here.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's weird.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,275
He said the dark, creepy alley close to the gates, but he's

17
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:41,000
not here.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe he's late.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you sure this is the dark, creepy alley he meant?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hmm. I was.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay. New plan.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,578
You stay here, just in case this is the spot he meant, and

23
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll look around.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay. I'll hold down the fort.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thanks, Jesse.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,780
I'll be back before you know it. If he shows up while I'm

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,000
gone, just stall for me.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And just who are you?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm waiting.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Answer me.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not here.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not here.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not here.
