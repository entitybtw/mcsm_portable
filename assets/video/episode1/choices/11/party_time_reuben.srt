00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We deserve a victory party! Who’s in?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I like ALL kinds of parties -- but especially ones where I get to celebrate winning.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
‘Bout time I’ll be the guest of honor at something.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Hey, Jesse. It’s time to go see about that -- thing.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,700
Oh, right, The “thing”.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,500
Subtle.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As a punch to the face. Axel and I were gonna head into Endercon anyway -- see you in there?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,500
I heard somebody saying there’s free cake by the map booth.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Hurry -- we’re supposed to meet in the alley over there.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dark. Dark. Very dark in here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,200
That's weird -- he said the dark, creepy alleyway close to the gates, but he's not here. Maybe he's late.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you sure THIS is the dark, creepy alleyway he was talking about?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Hmm. I WAS

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,500
Okay, new plan. You stay here just in case this IS the spot he meant, and I'll look around.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Thanks, Jesse. I'll be back before you know it. If he shows up while I'm gone, just stall for me.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And just who are YOU?
