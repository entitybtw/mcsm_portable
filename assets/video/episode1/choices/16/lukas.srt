00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, uh, Lukas? Can you do me a favor?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Anything's possible.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,000
I need slime balls. I swear I have a really good explanation --

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Whatever you guys are doing, count me in.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thanks, Lukas.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Told you he was useful.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Aw, man --this guy isn't actually cool, is he?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,750
Remains to be seen.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,000
It's craftin' time.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Ta-da! One slime block!

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Gross!

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll take that. Riiiiight there.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's all you, Jesse.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Gimme a boost.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,750
My poultry! My precious poultry!

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Keep your eyes closed! They'll peck out your eyes!

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,750
Now's our chance!

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
Hey!

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Where'd he go?

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
There! Through that door!

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,831
What do we do once we catch him?
