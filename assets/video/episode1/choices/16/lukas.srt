00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hey, uh, Lucas, can you do me a favor?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Anything's possible.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,500
I need slimeballs. I swear I have a really good explanation.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Whatever you guys are doing, count me in.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thanks, Lucas.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Told you he was useful.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Aw, man. This guy isn't actually cool, is he?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Remains to be seen.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
It's craft at a time.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm gonna do it.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Ta-da! One slime block.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Gross.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I'll take that.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Right...

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
...through.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
It's all you, Jesse.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Give me a boost.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,720
Pkey

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Squishy

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Squishy

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Squishy

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Aw, sir!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Now, that's okay!

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
He's aiation, boss.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,500
While the office shits.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey!

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Where'd he go?

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,620
There!

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,620
Through that door.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:38,860
What do we do once we catch him?

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,040
There are a million ways to play this.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,220
But considering this isn't my fight, I'll follow your lead.
