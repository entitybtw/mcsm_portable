1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm going after Lukas by myself.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
By yourself? Are you sure Jesse?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,400
Yeah. The rest of you, go get Gabriel.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,300
We're on it, Jesse.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,200
We'll figure it out a way to warn Gabriel and then we'll meet you back here.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's crash this party.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,900
I'll be back as soon as I can.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
Be careful.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Here goes nothing…

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Lukas? Can you hear me... even though I'm whispering?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Jesse? Is that you whispering super loudly?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Lukas! Over here!

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey!

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
You okay?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,281
Eh, I've been worse.
