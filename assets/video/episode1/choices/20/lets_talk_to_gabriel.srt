1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,941
We need Gabriel to get Lukas back and to deal with

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,000
everything else we saw down there.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're doing the right thing, Jesse.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,666
I just hope Lukas can hold out against that golem long

5
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,000
enough for us to get help.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, then.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's crash this party.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,373
With the right training and guidance, anyone, and I mean

9
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:19,000
anyone, can become a hero.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You just have to believe it.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll get you a rookie in the office.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We just gotta push through this crowd to get to Gabriel.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Start believing it.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then...

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now I'd like to open up the floor for a few questions.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Keep it orderly, folks.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And you, right there in the front row.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, with, uh, Elgar and the dragon.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Um, like, what was her favorite food?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Red, next question.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What question do you have for the mighty Gabriel?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Every person here is in danger.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now hold on just a minute.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If this is a joke, it isn't funny.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not joking.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Somebody's been building a monster in the basement.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hmm.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Perhaps we should have this checked out.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have a question for you.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Excuse me, sir.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You'll have to wait your turn.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just tell me first.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you really believe anyone can be great?

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
With enough hard work?

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Was that where I went wrong?

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I simply didn't work hard enough?

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ivor?

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's the guy who attacked us in the basement.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wish I could say I was surprised.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If it surprises you want, you're in for a treat.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why don't you tell them the real story, Gabriel?

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see time has made you bitter.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's made you an even bigger fool.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now these people were promised greatness,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and I'm ready to deliver.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry this is how they had to learn the truth.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.
