1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
We need Gabriel to get Lukas back.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,500
And to deal with everything else we saw down there.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,000
We're doing the right thing, Jesse.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I just hope Lukas can hold out against that golem for long enough for us to get help.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, then.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's crash this party.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With the right training, and guidance, anyone... and I mean anyone can become a hero.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You just have to believe it.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I want you to look me in the eyes.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've just gotta push through this crowd to get to Gabriel.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,500
Start. Believing. It.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
And then...

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now I'd like to open up the floor for a few questions.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Keep it orderly, folks.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Aaaaand -- you, right there in the front row.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
You know when uh... Ellegaard... and the dragon... umm... like what was her favorite food?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Bread. Next question.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What question do you have for the mighty Gabriel?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Every person here is in danger!

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, hold on just a minute. If this is a joke, it isn't funny.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not joking -- somebody's been building a monster in the basement.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hmm. Perhaps we should have this checked out...

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have a question for you.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Excuse me, sir -- you'll have to wait your turn!

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Just tell me first: do you really believe anyone can be great?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
With enough hard work -- yes!

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Was that where I went wrong? I simply didn't WORK hard enough?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Ivor?

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
That's the guy who attacked us in the basement!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
I wish I could say I was surprised.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
If it's surprises you want, you're in for a treat.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why don't you tell them the real story, Gabriel?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,300
I see time has made you bitter.

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's made YOU an even bigger fool.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now, these people were promised greatness -- and I'm ready to deliver.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry this is how they had to learn the truth...
