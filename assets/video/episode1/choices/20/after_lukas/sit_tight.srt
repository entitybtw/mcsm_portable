1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Just sit tight Lukas, I'll get you out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You came back just to tell me that.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's part of the plan.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Stay exactly where you are is a plan?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now Lukas, run!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nice one Reuben.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay Jesse, come on. Let's go.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thanks for coming back for me.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I didn't know if anybody was going to.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No man left behind, that's my motto.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Guess I owe you one.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where are the others?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Dude, I don't know how it can be any clearer.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Dude, I don't know how it can be any clearer.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Weird guy, doing weird stuff.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Freaky, with a side of strange.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why won't you listen to me?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you want me to do? Tell you charade style?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I promise you.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's the last thing I want you to do.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Four words, six syllables.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sounds like...

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Monster and the Schmaceman.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Next.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wait, just...

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I have a question for you.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You'll have to wait your turn.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Just tell me first.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you really believe anyone can be great?

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
With enough hard work?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Was that where I went wrong?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I simply didn't work hard enough?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A highball?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's the guy who attacked us in the basement.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I wish I could say I was surprised.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If it surprises you want,

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you're in for a treat.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why don't you tell them the real story, Gabriel?

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see time has made you bitter.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And it's made you an even bigger fool.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now these people were promised greatness

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and I'm ready to deliver.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry, this is how they had to learn the truth.
