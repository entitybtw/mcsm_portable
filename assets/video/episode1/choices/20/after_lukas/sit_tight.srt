1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Just sit tight, Lukas. I'll get you out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You came back just to tell me that?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's part of the plan.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
'Stay exactly where you are' is a plan?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,700
Now Lukas! Run!

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,250
Nice one, Rueben!

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay Jesse, come on! Let's go!

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Thanks for coming for me! I didn't know if anybody was going to…

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,700
No man left behind. That's my motto.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
Guess I owe you one.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where are the others?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Dude, I dunno how can I be any clearer!

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Weird guy! Doing weird stuff! Freaky with a side of strange!

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Why won't you listen to me? What do you want me to do? Tell you charades-style?

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
I promise you, that's the last thing I want you to do.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,700
Four words; six syllabes; sounds like... Schmonster in the schmasement".

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,500
Next.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,900
Wait, just --

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,900
I have a question for you.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,900
Excuse me, sir -- you'll have to wait your turn!

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Just tell me first: do you really believe anyone can be great?

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
With enough hard work -- yes!

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Was that where I went wrong? I simply didn't WORK hard enough?

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
Ivor?

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,900
That's the guy who attacked us in the basement!

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,400
I wish I could say I was surprised.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,900
If it's surprises you want, you're in for a treat.

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Why don't you tell them the real story, Gabriel?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,200
I see time has made you bitter.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,900
And it's made YOU an even bigger fool.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Now, these people were promised greatness -- and I'm ready to deliver.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,900
I'm sorry this is how they had to learn the truth...
