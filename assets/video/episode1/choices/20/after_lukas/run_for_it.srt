1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Just...run.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Run where? You don't think I tried that already?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,700
Now Lukas! Run!

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,250
Nice one, Rueben!

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay Jesse, come on! Let's go!

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Thanks for coming for me! I didn't know if anybody was going to…

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,700
No man left behind. That's my motto.

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Guess I owe you one.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where are the others?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Dude, I dunno how can I be any clearer!

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,800
Weird guy! Doing weird stuff! Freaky with a side of strange!

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Why won't you listen to me? What do you want me to do? Tell you charades-style?

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
I promise you, that's the last thing I want you to do.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,700
Four words; six syllabes; sounds like... Schmonster in the schmasement".

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,500
Next.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,900
Wait, just --

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I have a question for you.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Excuse me, sir -- you'll have to wait your turn!

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Just tell me first: do you really believe anyone can be great?

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,900
With enough hard work -- yes!

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,900
Was that where I went wrong? I simply didn't WORK hard enough?

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,400
Ivor?

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,900
That's the guy who attacked us in the basement!

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,400
I wish I could say I was surprised.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,900
If it's surprises you want, you're in for a treat.

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Why don't you tell them the real story, Gabriel?

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,200
I see time has made you bitter.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,900
And it's made YOU an even bigger fool.

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Now, these people were promised greatness -- and I'm ready to deliver.

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm sorry this is how they had to learn the truth...
