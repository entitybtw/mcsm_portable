1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
We're the Order of the Pig.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Really?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Is it meant to tie us to Reuben, or are you making fun of me?

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, Order of the Pig.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,300
You guys are in Booth 5.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is that a freakin' beacon?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
They have a freakin' beacon?!

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Freakin' Beacon!?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's stained glass.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
They aren't just building a beacon.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
They're building a rainbow beacon.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Our design is way cooler.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
A gigantic enderman is better than a fancy light.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,000
But we’ve got something they don’t... fireworks.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,500
We should probably stop staring at them.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Hahaha! Look, it's the Order of the Losers. Again.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
Good one, Gill!

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,000
We're just looking.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There’ll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're being unpleasant.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Maybe not all of you…

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shut up.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What's that?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Jesse said “shut up.“

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Do you need to hear it again?

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know, maybe?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Stop wasting your time, Aiden. 

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
We've got work to do.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
You're lucky I'm busy.

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey Jesse. Guys.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey Petra.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
How's the build going?

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,800
Only time will tell. But we’re optimistic.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey Petra, I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey Lukas.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Not a problem.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
You helped these tools?

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
For the right price, I’ll help anyone.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,000
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
None of us know where to find you.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No hard feelings guys.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.
