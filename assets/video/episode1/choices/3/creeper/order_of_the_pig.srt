1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
We're the Order of the Pig.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Really?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Is it meant to tie us to Reuben, or are you making fun of me?

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, Order of the Pig.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,300
You guys are in Booth 5.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is that a freakin' beacon?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
They have a freakin' beacon?!

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Freakin' Beacon!?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's stained glass.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
They aren't just building a beacon.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
They're building a rainbow beacon.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Our design is way cooler.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Our design is better. A creeper that shoots fireworks is cooler than a fancy light.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,700
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,200
But we’ve got something they don’t... fireworks.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,700
We should probably stop staring at them.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Hahaha! Look, it's the Order of the Losers. Again.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,700
Good one, Gill!

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,200
We're just looking.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
There’ll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
You're being unpleasant.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Maybe not all of you…

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Shut up.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
What's that?

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Jesse said “shut up.“

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Do you need to hear it again?

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,200
I don't know, maybe?

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,700
We've got work to do.

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
You're lucky I'm busy.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,200
Hey Jesse. Guys.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Hey Petra.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,700
How's the build going?

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,000
Only time will tell. But we’re optimistic.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
Hey Petra, I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Hey Lukas.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Not a problem.

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,700
You helped these tools?

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,700
For the right price, I’ll help anyone.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,200
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
None of us know where to find you.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Exactly.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
No hard feelings guys.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.
