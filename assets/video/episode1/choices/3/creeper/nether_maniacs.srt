1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
We're the Nether Maniacs.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
You've just thought of that right now?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yup.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've never even been to the Nether.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Who the Nether cares?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, Nether Maniacs. You guys are in Booth 5.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Is that a freakin' beacon?

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,800
They have a freakin' beacon?!

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,300
Freakin' Beacon!?

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
That's stained glass.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
They aren't just building a beacon.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,800
They're building a rainbow beacon.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Our design is way cooler.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,300
Our design is better. A creeper that shoots fireworks is cooler than a fancy light.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
But we’ve got something they don’t... fireworks.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
We should probably stop staring at them.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Hahaha! Look, it's the Order of the Losers. Again.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Good one, Gill!

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
We're just looking.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
There’ll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
You're being unpleasant.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Maybe not all of you…

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Shut up.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
What's that?

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Jesse said “shut up.“

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you need to hear it again?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
I don't know, maybe?

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,000
We've got work to do.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
You're lucky I'm busy.

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey Jesse. Guys.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey Petra.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
How's the build going?

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,100
Only time will tell. But we’re optimistic.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,500
Hey Petra, I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Hey Lukas.

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Not a problem.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
You helped these tools?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For the right price, I’ll help anyone.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,500
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
None of us know where to find you.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Exactly.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
No hard feelings guys.

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.
