1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The "Warrior Whip!"

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Aaaand just like that, I’m nervous again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don’t talk like that! We can do this! Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
This year, we can't lose!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's do it.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Building... starts... now!

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, no! A fireworks dispenser?! I’m soooo scared!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,300
You worry about your build and we’ll worry about ours.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,900
And now, the moment of truth.

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,500
Here goes nothing…

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,800
Aw man, that looks so cool. We’ll win this for sure.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,500
The Creeper was definitely the right way to go.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
Guys, people are looking at us.

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,123
Good build, man!

15
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,900
What?

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
No way...

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
It's just a bunch of dyed wool!?

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Oh, no! Reuben's on fire!

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,700
Reuben, no! Come back!

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,300
The lava's getting closer!

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,000
It's gonna ruin the build!

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Reuben's going to get lost!

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You guys stay and save the build.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,600
On it!

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
We've got it covered, Jesse. Be careful.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
We’ll meet up with you at Endercon!

27
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Reuben?! Where are you?

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just give me an oink if you can hear me.
