1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The warrior whip.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And just like that, I'm nervous again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't talk like that, we can do this.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This year, we can't lose.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's do it.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Building starts now!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh no! A fireworks dispenser! I'm so scared!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You worry about your build, and we'll worry about ours.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And now, the moment of truth.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here goes nothing.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh man, that looks so cool. We'll win this for sure.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The creeper was definitely the right way.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good job, guys!

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good job, man!

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh my.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh no, Ruben's on fire!

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ruben, no! Come back!

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The lava's getting closer.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What about the build?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ruben's going to get lost.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You guys stay and save the build, on it.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We've got to cover, Jesse. Be careful.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll meet up with you at Endercon.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ruben, where are you, buddy?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just oink if you can hear me.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, so now you get to choose where to go.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Go ahead, select a location.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to go to the end of the road.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to go to the end of the road.
