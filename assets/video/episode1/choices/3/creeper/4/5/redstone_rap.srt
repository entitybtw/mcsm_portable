1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Redstone Wrap.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And just like that, I'm nervous again.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,089
Don't talk like that. We can do this. Just stick to the

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,000
plan and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This year, we can't lose.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's do it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Building starts now!

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh no! A fireworks dispenser! I'm so scared!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You worry about your build, and we'll worry about ours.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And now, the moment of truth.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here goes nothing.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh man, that looks so cool. We'll win this for sure.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The creeper was definitely the right way to go.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Guys, we're looking at a...

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good build, man!

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No way.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh no! Reuben's on fire!

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Reuben, no! Come back!

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The lava's getting closer.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Where's the build?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Reuben's going to get lost.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You guys stay and save the build.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
On it.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You've got it covered, Jesse. Be careful.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We'll meet up with you at Endercon.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Reuben? Where are you, buddy? Just oink if you can hear me.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,944
Okay, so now you get to choose where to go. Go ahead,

30
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,000
select a location.
