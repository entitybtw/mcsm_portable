1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The "Redstone Rap!"

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Aaaand just like that, I’m nervous again.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Don’t talk like that! We can do this! Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
This year, we can't lose!

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Let's do it.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Building... starts... now!

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh, no! A fireworks dispenser?! I’m soooo scared!

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
You worry about your build and we’ll worry about ours.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,400
And now, the moment of truth.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
Here goes nothing…

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,300
Aw man, that looks so cool. We’ll win this for sure.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,000
The Creeper was definitely the right way to go.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,623
Good build, man!

15
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,400
What?

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
No way...

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool!?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, no! Reuben's on fire!

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
Reuben, no! Come back!

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
The lava's getting closer!

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,500
It's gonna ruin the build!

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Reuben's going to get lost!

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
You guys stay and save the build.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,100
On it!

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,500
We've got it covered, Jesse. Be careful.

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000
We’ll meet up with you at Endercon!

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Reuben?! Where are you?

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Just give me an oink if you can hear me.
