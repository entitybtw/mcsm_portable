00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
We’re going to crush you.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,900
I don’t know if you know this, but... we’re pretty good…

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,200
Ohhh. Wait. I get it. It’s like a joke, right?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,600
No, I'm serious. We're going to destroy you.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,300
Ha! Y'know, you're really funny. That's awesome. 

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,400
Hey, good luck.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,850
Ladies and gentlemen...

Ocelots! Ocelots! Ocelots!

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Whoa. Handshake? We don’t have a handshake.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,018
We’ll just make one up.
