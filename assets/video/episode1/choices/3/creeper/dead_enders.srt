1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're the Dead Enders.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whoa! It sounds like a name for pirates.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cool.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, Dead Enders. You guys are in Booth 5.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
Is that a freakin' beacon?

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,800
They have a freakin' beacon?!

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,300
Freakin' Beacon!?

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
That's stained glass.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
They aren't just building a beacon.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
They're building a rainbow beacon.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Our design is way cooler.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,500
Our design is better. A creeper that shoots fireworks is cooler than a fancy light.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
But we’ve got something they don’t... fireworks.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
We should probably stop staring at them.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Hahaha! Look, it's the Order of the Losers. Again.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Good one, Gill!

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
We're just looking.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
There’ll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
You're being unpleasant.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Maybe not all of you…

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Shut up.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
What's that?

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Jesse said “shut up.“

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you need to hear it again?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,500
I don't know, maybe?

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
We've got work to do.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're lucky I'm busy.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Hey Jesse. Guys.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Hey Petra.

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
How's the build going?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,100
Only time will tell. But we’re optimistic.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,500
Hey Petra, I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Hey Lukas.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Not a problem.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
You helped these tools?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For the right price, I’ll help anyone.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,500
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
None of us know where to find you.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Exactly.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
No hard feelings guys.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.
