1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're the DeadEnders.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whoa. Sounds like a name for pirates.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cool.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, DeadEnders. You guys are in booth five.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is that a freakin' beacon?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They have a freakin' beacon?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Freakin' beacon?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Again.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're lucky I'm busy.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey, Josie. Guys.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey, Petra.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How's the build going?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Only time will tell, but we're optimistic.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey, Petra. I forgot to thank you for that Nether Star.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hey, Lukas. Not a problem.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can you help these tools?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For the right price, I'll help anyone.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
None of us know where to find you.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Exactly.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No hard feelings, guys.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So why don't we just forget about all this

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and, you know, make this about how cool our builds are?
