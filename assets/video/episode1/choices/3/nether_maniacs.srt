1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're the Nether Maniacs.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You just thought of that right now?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yep.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've never even been to the Nether.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Who the Nether cares?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, Nether Maniacs, you guys are in booth five.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is that a freakin' beacon?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They have a freakin' beacon?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Freakin' beacon?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's stained glass.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
They aren't just building a beacon.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They're building a rainbow beacon.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Our design is way cooler.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A gigantic Enderman is better than a fancy light.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,469
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total

16
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:54,000
score.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We've got something they don't.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Fireworks.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We should probably stop staring at them.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Look, it's the Order of the Losers again.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good one, Gil.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're just looking.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,085
There'll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after

24
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,000
it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're being unpleasant.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Maybe not all of you.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shut up.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What's that?

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Jesse said shut up.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you need to hear it again?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't know.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Maybe.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We've got work to do.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're lucky I'm busy.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, Jesse.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Guys.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey, Petra.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How's the build going?

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Only time will tell, but we're optimistic.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey, Petra.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I forgot to thank you for that Nether Star.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, Lukas.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Not a problem.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You help these tools?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For the right price, I'll help anyone.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
None of us know where to find you.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No hard feelings, guys.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,489
So why don't we just forget about all this and, you know,

54
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,000
make this about how cool our builds are?

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thanks.
