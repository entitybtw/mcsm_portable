1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're the DeadEnders.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whoa. Sounds like a name for pirates.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cool.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, DeadEnders. You guys are in booth five.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is that a freakin' beacon?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They have a freakin' beacon?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Freakin' beacon?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's stained glass.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They aren't just building a beacon.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They're building a rainbow beacon.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Our design is way cooler.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A gigantic Enderman is better than a fancy light.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,575
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total

14
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,000
score.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We've got something they don't.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fireworks.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We should probably stop staring at them.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ha ha ha.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look. It's the Order of the Losers again.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ha ha. Good one, Gil.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're just looking.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,085
There'll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after

23
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:10,000
it wins and gets shown at EnderCon.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're being unpleasant.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe not all of you.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
EnderCon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Shut up.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's that?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Jesse said, shut up.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you need to hear it again?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know. Maybe.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Stop wasting your time, Aiden. We've got work to do.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're lucky I'm busy.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey, Jesse. Guys.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey, Petra.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How's the build going?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Only time will tell, but we're optimistic.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hey, Petra. I forgot to thank you for that Nether Star.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey, Lucas. Not a problem.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You help these tools?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For the right price, I'll help anyone.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
None of us know where to find you.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Exactly.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No hard feelings, guys.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,489
So why don't we just forget about all this and, you know,

48
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,000
make this about how cool our builds are?
