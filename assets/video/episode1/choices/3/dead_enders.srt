1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're the Dead Enders.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whoa! It sounds like a name for pirates.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cool.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, Dead Enders. You guys are in Booth 5.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
Is that a freakin' beacon?

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,800
They have a freakin' beacon?!

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,300
Freakin' Beacon!?

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
That's stained glass.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
They aren't just building a beacon.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
They're building a rainbow beacon.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Our design is way cooler.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,300
A gigantic enderman is better than a fancy light.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,800
Their difficulty score is going to be higher than our total score.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,300
But we’ve got something they don’t... fireworks.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,800
We should probably stop staring at them.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,300
Hahaha! Look, it's the Order of the Losers. Again.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,800
Good one, Gill!

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,300
We're just looking.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,300
There’ll be plenty of time for you all to look at it after it wins and gets shown at Endercon.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,300
You're being unpleasant.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Maybe not all of you…

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Endercon doesn't allow outside food or drink.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Shut up.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,300
What's that?

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Jesse said “shut up.“

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,800
Do you need to hear it again?

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,300
I don't know, maybe?

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Stop wasting your time, Aiden.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,800
We've got work to do.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
You're lucky I'm busy.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,300
Hey Jesse. Guys.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Hey Petra.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,800
How's the build going?

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,900
Only time will tell. But we’re optimistic.

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,300
Hey Petra, I forgot to thank you for that nether star.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Hey Lukas.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
Not a problem.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,800
You helped these tools?

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
For the right price, I’ll help anyone.

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,300
If you need anything, you know where to find me.

41
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
None of us know where to find you.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Exactly.

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
No hard feelings guys.

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,300
If you're cool with Petra, you're cool with us.
