1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wow.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's absolutely incredible.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How did they build this?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This looks like some sort of tracking system.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the Order. It's showing where they are right now.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Look, we don't know enough about how this thing works.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,419
Maybe the amulet only tracks them when they're on the

8
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:39,000
surface.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Or maybe it doesn't work when they're in the Nether.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We have to go off what we do know.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Petra is relying on us.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That Witherstorm is still out there.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We know that Gabriel was trying to tell us something.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We've got to find the Order of the Stone.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But there are only two lights.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There are only two members of the Order left.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He said Sorin was missing.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That leaves Magnus.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Or Ellegaardd.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's head out.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not going with you guys. I have to stay here.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,657
If I know Petra, she's probably doing everything she can to

23
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:19,000
find this place.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just stay safe, okay?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If there's even a small chance she's alive, I have to stay.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Go. Get help.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,467
I'm going to focus on making this place safe before

28
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,000
nightfall.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This temple is pretty big though.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,025
If we're going to have a chance at fortifying it, I'm going

31
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,000
to need some help.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If maybe one of you guys can hang back with me.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,097
Sounds like Olivia will have you totally covered while me

34
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,000
and Jessie are out finding Magnus.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,737
Finding Magnus? You really think that's how it's going to

36
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:49,000
go?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We need Ellegaardd. She's the world's greatest engineer.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She'll figure out a way to stop that thing.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We're trying to destroy it.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And when it comes to destruction, Magnus is the master.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're a smart person, Jessie.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Obviously, the smart thing to do is to go get Magnus.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I... think Axel meant Ellegaardd there, Jessie.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Uh, no. I don't think I did. Pretty sure Axel meant Magnus.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,470
Jessie, the point is you should be going to Ellegaardd's. It's

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,000
the clear choice to make.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You've got to come with me.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're my best friend, Jessie.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's you and me. Like always.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Think about it, Jessie.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is more of a gut call.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,411
We need to make sure we get this right. We're not going to

53
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,000
get a second shot at this.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Whatever decision you make, I'll be cool with it.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Really?

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
As long as it's me.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on, Jessie. This is an easy call.
