1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Wow.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
It's absolutely incredible.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How did they build this?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This looks like some sort of tracking system.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the Order! It's showing where they are now!

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Look, we don't know enough about how this thing works.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe the amulet only tracks them when they're on the surface.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Or maybe it doesn't work when they're in the Nether.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We have to go off of what we DO know.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Petra's relying on us.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That Wither Storm is still out there.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We KNOW that Gabriel was trying to tell us something.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We've got to find the Order of the Stone.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But... There are only two lights?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There are only two members of the Order left?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He said Soren was missing.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,500
That leaves Magnus...

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Or Ellegaard.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's head out.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm not going with you guys, I have to stay here.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,000
If I know Petra, she's probably doing everything she can to find this place.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just... Stay safe okay?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,500
If there's even a small chance she's alive... I have to stay.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Go. Get help.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,250
I'm going to focus on making this place safe before nightfall.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,800
This temple is pretty big though.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,000
If we're gonna have a chance at fortifying it, I'm going to need some help.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,800
If, uh, maybe one of you guys could hang back with me?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sounds like Olivia's have you totally covered while me and Jesse are out finding Magnus.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
"Finding Magnus"? You really think that's how it's going to go?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We need Ellegaard. She's the world's greatest engineer.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She'll figure out a way to stop that thing.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We're trying to DESTROY it.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And when it comes to "destruction", Magnus is the master.
