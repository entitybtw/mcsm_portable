1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,00
This can't be good.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
But nothing built can last forever, Gabriel.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
Ivor, no!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Creature -- attack!

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Everyone stay calm! This foul beast is no match for me!

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Creature -- attack!

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
What have you done?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,700
Gabriel!

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,000
No! Stay away! It's after me, not you!

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Look at him! The mighty Gabriel!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Looks like true greatness is out of his reach.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He may not be able to defeat this creature -- but I can!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Creature -- retreat!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ahem. Creature -- retreat!
