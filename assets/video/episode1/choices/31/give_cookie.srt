1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Take it, Lukas.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,560
Oh, no, no, I -- can't do that.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,250
I insist.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you, Jesse.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,300
That was for you, Jesse. Not him.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,120
If you had to... which would you rather fight…

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,634
A hundred chicken-sized zombies, or ten zombie-sized chickens?

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,000
Choose wisely...

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,160
That's a good one. Let me think.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,000
How can you guys joke at a time like this?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Petra is still out there.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Petra wouldn't mind at all.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,520
She'd want us to keep our spirits up.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,520
If I were her, I'd... I dunno. It feels wrong.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,080
Fine, then. We should get some rest.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,400
We gotta start looking for this temple as early as we can.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,560
Now, my guess is, if we start at the portal and kind of split up --

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Whoa, what are you doing?

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
He's just trying to help.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
See?

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm sorry, Jesse, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this guy telling us what's what.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,800
You're the only one wearing that stupid jacket.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,360
Don't tell us what to do.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Take. That. Back.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Can't.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Wouldn't.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
You know what?

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
I get to wear this jacket because I know how to build.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,200
But that doesn't mean I don't know how to break things.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Your threats don't scare me, now that we know how you really are.

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,800
Jesse... Your friend is WAY out of line.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Let's just drop it.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't be like that, Jesse.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,480
Just drop it.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,400
Haven't you done enough damage for one day?

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,080
Petra might be dead because of you.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
You're taking this too far, Axel.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't have to take this.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,034
Listen... Why don't I just leave and let you guys hash this out.
