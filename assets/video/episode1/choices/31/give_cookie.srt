1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Take it Lukas.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,560
No no I can't do that.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,560
I insist.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,040
Thank you Jesse.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,800
That was for you Jesse not him.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,120
If you had to, which would you rather fight?

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,634
A hundred chicken sized zombies or ten zombie sized

8
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:47,520
chickens?

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Choose wisely.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,440
That's a good one.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,160
Let me think.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,000
How can you guys joke at a time like this?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Petra is still out there.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Petra wouldn't mind at all.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,520
She'd want us to keep our spirits up.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Fire her?

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I don't know.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
It feels wrong.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Fine.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,080
Then we should get some rest.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,400
We gotta start looking for this temple as early as we can.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,287
Now my guess is if we start at the portal and kinda split

23
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:19,560
up.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Oh what are you doing?

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
He's just trying to help.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
See?

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm sorry Jesse.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,189
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this guy telling us

29
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:27,800
what's what.

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,800
You're the only one wearing that stupid jacket.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,360
Don't tell us what to do.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Take that back.

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Can't.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Wouldn't.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
You know what?

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
I get to wear this jacket because I know how to build.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,200
But that doesn't mean I don't know how to break things.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,297
Your threats don't scare me now that we know how you really

40
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:48,560
are.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,800
Jesse, your friend is way out of line.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Let's just drop it.

43
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't be like that Jesse.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,480
Just drop it.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Haven't you done enough damage for one day?

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,080
Petra might be dead because of you.

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
You're taking this too far Axel.

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't have to take this.

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,034
Listen, why don't I just leave and let you guys hash this

50
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:09,480
out.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
You can't leave.

52
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
It's dangerous out there.

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,960
I can take care of myself.

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
It's what Axel wants right?

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Let him leave if he wants to leave.
