1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,620
If you had to... which would you rather fight…

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,134
A hundred chicken-sized zombies, or ten zombie-sized chickens?

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,500
Choose wisely...

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,660
That's a good one. Let me think.

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,500
How can you guys joke at a time like this?

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Petra is still out there.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,260
Petra wouldn't mind at all.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,020
She'd want us to keep our spirits up.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,020
If I were her, I'd... I dunno. It feels wrong.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,580
Fine, then. We should get some rest.

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,900
We gotta start looking for this temple as early as we can.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,060
Now, my guess is, if we start at the portal and kind of split up --

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,060
Whoa, what are you doing?

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
He's just trying to help.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
See?

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm sorry, Jesse, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this guy telling us what's what.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,300
You're the only one wearing that stupid jacket.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,860
Don't tell us what to do.

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,860
Take. That. Back.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,860
Can't.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,860
Wouldn't.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,860
You know what?

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
I get to wear this jacket because I know how to build.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,700
But that doesn't mean I don't know how to break things.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,060
Your threats don't scare me, now that we know how you really are.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,300
Jesse... Your friend is WAY out of line.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Let's just drop it.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Don't be like that, Jesse.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,980
Just drop it.

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,900
Haven't you done enough damage for one day?

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,580
Petra might be dead because of you.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,460
You're taking this too far, Axel.

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
I don't have to take this.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,534
Listen... Why don't I just leave and let you guys hash this out.
