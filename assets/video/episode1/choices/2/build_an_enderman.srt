1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's build an Enderman.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Ah...

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
a Libius thing?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,340
Are you whining?

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,140
No, I was saying, ah...

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,140
song.

7
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,140
Yeah.

8
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,880
I think this is the first time we've decided on something

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,680
before getting to the competition.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,380
Think we've got everything we need?

11
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,380
It wouldn't hurt to grab a little more.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,380
Let's get to grabbing then.

13
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,580
We're so prepared. We can't lose.

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,580
Cannot.

15
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,580
Bring it in.

16
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,080
Dare to prepare on three.

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
No, no, no.

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,660
Preparing is...

19
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,660
Darren.

20
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,660
No, that's the same thing.

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,660
Forget it.

22
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,160
Team on three.

23
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,660
One, two, three.

24
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,660
Team prepared.

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,660
One, two, three.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
We know what we're building.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
We've got all the stuff for it.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
We are so ready.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
This year, it's going to be different.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm not just ready to build.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
I'm ready to win.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Nice pig, losers.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Mmm.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm not ready to win.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm ready to win.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm ready to win.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm ready to win.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm ready to win.

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm ready to win.

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Mmm.

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Oh, great.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
There's Lukas and the Ocelots.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
The rivalry continues.

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Man, they've got matching leather jackets and everything.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
So cool.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Well, well, well.

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
If it isn't the Order of the Losers.

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Great. The fail squad's here.

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Lukas, get a load of these losers.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's go, guys.

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Name, please.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Axel.

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
How do you do?

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
No, your team name.

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Team name?

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
We are not ready for this.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
So much for losing anonymously.
