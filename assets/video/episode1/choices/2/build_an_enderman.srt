1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let’s build an enderman!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Aww… Olivia’s thing?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,340
Are you whining?

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,140
No, I was saying “awesome”.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,680
Yeah. I think this is the first time we've decided on something before getting to the competition.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,380
Think we've got everything we need?

11
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,380
It wouldn't hurt to grab a little more.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,380
Let's get with the Grabbin', then.

13
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,580
We're so prepared. We can't lose. Cannot. Bring it in.

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,080
"Dare to Prepare" on three.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,000
No. "Preparing is Daring"

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,700
Nope, that's the same thing- forget it.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,500
"Team" on three. One, two, three...

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Team!

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,160
We know what we're building, we've got all the stuff for it. We are so ready.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
This year, it's going to be different.

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,00
I'm not just ready to build. I'm ready to win.

22
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:57,160
Nice pig, losers.

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Oh, great.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
There's Lukas and the Ocelots.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,000
The rivalry continues.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,240
Man, they've got matching leather jackets and everything.

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
So cool...

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Well well well, if it isn't the Order of the Losers.

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Great, the fail squad's here.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Lukas, get a load of these losers!

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's go, guys.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Name, please?

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Axel, and how do you do?

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
No, your team name.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Team name?

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
We are not ready for this.
