1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let's build the creeper.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're going with Axel's idea?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What's wrong with my idea?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nothing. It could be totally cool.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It is cool.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,704
Yeah. I think this is the first time we've decided on

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:15,000
something before getting to the competition.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Think we've got everything we need?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It wouldn't hurt to grab a little more.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's get to grabbing, then.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're so prepared. We can't lose. Cannot.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bring it in.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Dare to prepare on three.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, no, no. Preparing is...

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Darren. No, that's the same thing. Forget it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Team on three. One, two, three.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Team prepared.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, no.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,636
We know what we're building. We've got all the stuff for

21
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:49,000
it. We are so ready.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,352
This year, it's going to be different. I'm not just ready

23
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,000
to build. I'm ready to win.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nice pig, losers.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,968
Oh, great. There's Lukas and the Ocelots. The rivalry

26
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:05,000
continues.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Man, they've got matching leather jackets and everything.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So cool.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, well, well. If it isn't the order of the losers.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Great. The fail squad's here.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Lukas, get a load of these losers. Let's go, guys.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Name, please.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Axel. And how do you do?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, your team name.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Team name? We are not ready for this.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So much for losing anonymously.
