1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
All right, let's build the creeper.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
You're going with Axel's idea?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
What's wrong with my idea?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,700
Nothing. It could be totally cool.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,175
It IS cool!

6
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:15,715
Yeah. I think this is the first time we've decided on something before getting to the competition.

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,415
Think we've got everything we need?

11
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,415
It wouldn't hurt to grab a little more.

12
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,415
Let's get with the Grabbin', then.

13
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:25,615
We're so prepared. We can't lose. Cannot. Bring it in.

14
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,115
"Dare to Prepare" on three.

15
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,035
No. "Preparing is Daring"

16
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,735
Nope, that's the same thing- forget it.

17
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,535
"Team" on three. One, two, three...

18
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,535
Team!

19
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:49,195
We know what we're building, we've got all the stuff for it. We are so ready.

20
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:51,195
This year, it's going to be different.

21
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:55,035
I'm not just ready to build. I'm ready to win.

22
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,195
Nice pig, losers.

23
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,275
Oh, great.

24
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,275
There's Lukas and the Ocelots.

25
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,035
The rivalry continues.

26
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,275
Man, they've got matching leather jackets and everything.

27
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,275
So cool...

28
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:15,275
Well well well, if it isn't the Order of the Losers.

29
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,275
Great, the fail squad's here.

30
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,275
Lukas, get a load of these losers!

31
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,275
Let's go, guys.

32
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,275
Name, please?

33
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,355
Axel, and how do you do?

34
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,355
No, your team name.

35
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,355
Team name?

36
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,355
We are not ready for this.
