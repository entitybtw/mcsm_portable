1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know that stunt your friend pulled really hurt my pig.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, maybe, but I had nothing to do with that.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,031
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with long hair

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,000
and a beard roaming around, did you?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't think so. Why?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Whoa, everyone knows you don't mess with Petra.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't know what's good for you.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll keep an eye out, okay?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thanks, I appreciate it.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, uh, we're cool?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, we're cool.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Cool, cool.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
See you later, Lukas.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, see ya.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,462
I thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap,

17
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:42,000
didn't you?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, wiggle as much as you want.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're not going anywhere.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,653
Axel, listen up. Any chance you've seen a creepy-looking,

21
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:52,000
beardy guy anywhere?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No. Petra told me what happened.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm keeping an eye out for him.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's just this machine presses all my buttons.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Unnecessarily complicated, mean to birds for no reason.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Stop messing around. We need your help.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was looking, I swear.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've just got a short attention span.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright, alright, I'll look.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After I watch one more chicken ghetto.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I see you now, weirdo.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Wow, if it isn't Team Trashback.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How's your stupid pig?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm busy right now, man.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What, busy trying to get a life?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Busy trying to find some friends?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey, what do you think you're...

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you think you're doing?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Get away from me.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I said I was sorry.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Reuben, is that you?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Reuben!

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's my pig, you kidnapped my pig.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Please, he's my friend.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To me, he's inventory.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I might be amenable to some kind of trade.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not that you look like you got much of value.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Otherwise, it's straight to the slaughterhouse for this one.
