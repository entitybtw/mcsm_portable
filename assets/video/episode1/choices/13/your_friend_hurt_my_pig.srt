1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You know, that stunt your friend pulled really hurt my pig.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay, maybe, but I had nothing to do with that.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with a long hair and a beard roaming around, did you?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
I don't think so... why?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Whoa -- everyone knows, you don't mess with Petra.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Not if you know what's good for you.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I'll keep a eye out, okay?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Thanks, I appreciate it

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
So, uh, we're cool?

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah, we're cool.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Cool, cool.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,700
Ha! See you later, Lukas.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Yeah. See ya.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap, didn't you?

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Well -- Wiggle as much as you want -- you're not goin' anywhere

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,500
Axel, listen up -- any chance you've seen a creepy-looking beard-y guy anywhere?

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,200
No, but Petra told me what happened -- I'm keeping an eye out for him.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,762
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

20
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:08,700
It's just this machine presses all my buttons -- unnecessarily complicated, and mean to birds for no reason.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Stop messing around -- we need your help

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,200
I was looking, I swear -- I've just got a short attention span.

23
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,189
All right, all right. I'll look.

24
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,750
After I watch one more chicken get owned.

25
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,689
Ha! I see you now, weirdo...

26
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,689
Well, if it isn't Team Trashbag! How's your stupid pig?

27
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,189
I'm busy right now, man.

28
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,189
What? Busy trying to get a life? Busy trying to find some friends?

29
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:48,189
Hey!

30
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,180
Hey! Where do you think you're --

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,247
What do you think you're doing?

32
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,315
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,783
Get away from me!

34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,418
I said I was sorry.

35
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,557
Reuben? Is that you?!

36
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,263
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop!

37
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,233
Reuben!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,270
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

39
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,273
That's my pig! You kidnapped my pig!

40
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:25,745
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief. I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

41
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,280
Please. He's my friend.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,882
To me, he's inventory.

43
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,219
I might be amenable to some kind of trade...

44
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:40,060
Not that you look like you've got much of value. I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.
