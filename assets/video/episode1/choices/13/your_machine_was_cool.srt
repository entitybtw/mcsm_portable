1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your beacon wasn't too shabby.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You don't have to do that, okay?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You guys won fair and square.

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:11,666
Hey, you didn't happen to see a creepy guy with a long hair and a beard roaming around, did you?

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,166
I don't think so... why?

6
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,666
He kinda scammed Petra out of a diamond earlier.

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:19,266
Whoa -- everyone knows, you don't mess with Petra.

8
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,266
Not if you know what's good for you.

9
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,266
I'll keep a eye out, okay?

10
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,766
Thanks, I appreciate it

11
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:28,166
So, uh, we're cool?

12
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,066
Yeah, we're cool.

13
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,066
Cool, cool.

14
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,566
Ha! See you later, Lukas.

15
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,066
Yeah. See ya.

16
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,566
Thought you could just wiggle right out of that trap, didn't you?

17
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:46,466
Well -- Wiggle as much as you want -- you're not goin' anywhere

18
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:51,366
Axel, listen up -- any chance you've seen a creepy-looking beard-y guy anywhere?

19
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:56,066
No, but Petra told me what happened -- I'm keeping an eye out for him.

20
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,628
Okay, so I got a little distracted.

21
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:07,566
It's just this machine presses all my buttons -- unnecessarily complicated, and mean to birds for no reason.

22
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,566
Stop messing around -- we need your help

23
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:14,066
I was looking, I swear -- I've just got a short attention span.

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,255
All right, all right. I'll look.

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,816
After I watch one more chicken get owned.

26
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,755
Ha! I see you now, weirdo...

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,755
Well, if it isn't Team Trashbag! How's your stupid pig?

28
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,255
I'm busy right now, man.

29
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:45,255
What? Busy trying to get a life? Busy trying to find some friends?

30
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:47,255
Hey!

31
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,246
Hey! Where do you think you're --

32
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,313
What do you think you're doing?

33
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,381
Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,849
Get away from me!

35
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,484
I said I was sorry.

36
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,523
Reuben? Is that you?!

37
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:09,229
Nothing sticks to your ribs quite like a juicy pork chop!

38
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,199
Reuben!

39
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,336
What's the big idea? I'm trying to run a business here.

40
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:19,239
That's my pig! You kidnapped my pig!

41
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,711
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Chief. I found this pig wandering alone in the streets.

42
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,246
Please. He's my friend.

43
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,848
To me, he's inventory.

44
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,185
I might be amenable to some kind of trade...

45
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:39,026
Not that you look like you've got much of value. I gotta get some kind of return on my investment.
