1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
I'm cool if he's cool.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,138
It's settled, then -- you're both cool.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:7,807
Proceed, then.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,715
I'll take that diamond now.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,384
Take it, you've earned it.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,628
Uh, this isn't a diamond...

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,064
No, it's lapis!

8
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,216
I knew we couldn't trust that guy!

9
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,967
We're going after it!

10
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,839
I'm either getting that diamond, or I'm getting my skull back --

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,342
Or you'll make him pay, right? Right?

12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,426
Come on.

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,712
Do you see him anywhere?

14
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,267
We lost him.

15
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:54,520
Then we'll just have to find again. Go!

16
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,866
'Sup?

17
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,400
'Sup?

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,776
Nothing, 'sup with you?

19
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:27,003
Nothing, 'sup with YOU?

20
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,055
I just said -- nothing.

21
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,926
Hey, uh, congrats on the win.

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:38,698
I mean, I still think our beacon was amazing, but... you guys did a pretty good job, too.
