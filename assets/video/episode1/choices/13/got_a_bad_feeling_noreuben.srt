1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,571
Maybe we should rethink the whole thing. This guy gives me a bad feeling.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:08,375
I'll give you a bad feeling if you ruin this for me.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,044
Proceed, then.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,952
I'll take that diamond now.

5
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,621
Take it, you've earned it.

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,865
Uh, this isn't a diamond...

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,301
No, it's lapis!

8
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,453
I knew we couldn't trust that guy!

9
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,204
We're going after it!

10
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,076
I'm either getting that diamond, or I'm getting my skull back --

11
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,579
Or you'll make him pay, right? Right?

12
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,663
Come on.

13
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,949
Do you see him anywhere?

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,504
We lost.

15
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:57,757
Then we'll just have to find again. Go!

16
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,103
'Sup?

17
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:26,637
'Sup?

18
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,038
Nothing, 'sup with you?

19
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,240
Nothing, 'sup with YOU?

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,292
I just said -- nothing.

21
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,163
Hey, uh, congrats on the win.

22
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:41,935
I mean, I still think our beacon was amazing, but... you guys did a pretty good job, too.
