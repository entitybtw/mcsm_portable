00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Lukas!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,300
You guys just let me down there! Abandoned me!

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,750
No! We were trying to warn Gabriel and get him to help!

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,500
Jesse!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Wait -- wait! We have to stay together!

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
I can't hold on!

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,000
Do we still have everyone?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We must set out for my fortress -- we'll be better protected there.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Thanks for that just now.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, well, now we're even.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Incoming!

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This way.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
Hurry! Inside the temple!

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The inner chamber is built entirely of obsidian. We should be untouchable in there.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hurry! If you can get through the portal, you'll be safe!

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,250
Uh, something's not right here.

17
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,250
It's not lit!

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,250
Let's get out of here!

19
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone! Get in! NOW!

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Gabriel!

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There's so many of them... I-I can't save them all.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,250
I can't stop this by myself. We need to find the others.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Others?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,250
Soren's been missing for years. But the others -- you must seek them out.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Take this amulet. And guard it with your life.
