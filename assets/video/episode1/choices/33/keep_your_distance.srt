1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Just keep your distance.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Jesse, come on. He was here all night.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,500
No, it's okay. I'll take that.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, then. Let's head out.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Look at that thing.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,250
What is it?

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,250
Let's get a closer look.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,250
What?

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
What is this place?

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,250
That's what we're trying to figure out.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,250
It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,250
Lukas, are you sure?

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
He's right, look.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,250
Do you think they're in there?

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,250
Let's go in and find out.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,250
Let's just all be careful.

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,250
Okay.

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,964
If you spot anything, call it out. We don't have a lot of

20
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:12,250
time.

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,831
Isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to look like

22
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,250
spooky little faces?

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,250
What do you dispense little guy?

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,250
I get the feeling that we don't really want to find out.

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,250
Get behind me.

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,250
What was that?

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,250
That's probably not a good thing.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,250
Oh come on dispenser faces.

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,250
I thought we were friends.

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,250
Run!

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
We're trapped!

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,250
We activated the dispensers with that pressure plate.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,039
If we can figure out a way to trigger it again, I bet

34
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,250
that'll shut them off.

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,856
There's a crafting table, maybe we can make something

36
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:01,250
useful.

37
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,250
Out of what? We don't have anything.

38
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,250
All of our tools and materials are back home.

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,250
Alright everyone, empty your pockets.

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,250
Let's see who we've got to work with.

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
I have a good idea.

42
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Let's go.

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,250
Let's go.

44
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,250
Everyone empty your pockets.

45
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,250
Let's see who we've got to work with.

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,712
I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter

47
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:23,250
last night.

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250
I've got some flint and a piece of string.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,026
All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that

50
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,250
chicken machine exploded.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Let's see, I've got some flint, steel, sword.

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,250
Oh and some string from a spider that I fought in Windsor.

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,250
String, sticks, flint and feathers.

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's go.
