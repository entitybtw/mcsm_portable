1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,589
just keep your distance Jesse come on he was here all night

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,600
no it's okay I'll

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,680
take that all right then let's head out

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,160
look at that thing

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,720
what is it let's get a closer look

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,400
what are we waiting for let's go

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,470
what is this place that's what we're trying to figure out

9
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,000
it's the temple of

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,280
the order of the stone Lucas are you sure

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,704
he's right look do you think they're in there let's go in

12
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,160
and find out

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,451
let's just all be careful okay if you spot anything call it

14
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,920
out we don't have

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,278
a lot of time isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to

16
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:16,280
look like spooky

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,884
little faces what do you dispense little guy I get the

18
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,760
feeling that we don't

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:40,680
really want to find that's probably not a good thing

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:00,180
we're trapped we activated the dispensers with that

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,800
pressure plate if

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,850
we can figure out a way to trigger it again I bet that'll

23
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,600
shut them off

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,884
there's a crafting table maybe we can make something useful

25
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:10,720
how do what we

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,419
don't have anything all of our tools and materials are back

27
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,360

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,462
