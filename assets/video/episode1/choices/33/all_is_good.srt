1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're cool with me, Lukas.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Thanks, Jesse.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Me too.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Thanks...

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,000
If you're all right with them, then I guess I can live with it.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,750
Okay. I'll take that.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,000
All right, then. Let's head out.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Look at that thing.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,250
What is it?

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,250
Let's get a closer look.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,250
What?

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,250
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,250
What is this place?

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,250
That's what we're trying to figure out.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,250
It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
Lukas, are you sure?

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,250
He's right, look.

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,250
Do you think they're in there?

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,250
Let's go in and find out.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,250
Let's just all be careful.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,250
Okay.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,964
If you spot anything, call it out. We don't have a lot of

24
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:15,250
time.

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,831
Isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to look like

26
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,250
spooky little faces?

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,250
What do you dispense little guy?

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,250
I get the feeling that we don't really want to find out.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,250
Get behind me.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
What was that?

31
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,250
That's probably not a good thing.

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,250
Oh come on dispenser faces.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,250
I thought we were friends.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,250
Run!

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
We're trapped!

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,250
We activated the dispensers with that pressure plate.

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,039
If we can figure out a way to trigger it again, I bet

38
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,250
that'll shut them off.

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,856
There's a crafting table, maybe we can make something

40
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:04,250
useful.

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,250
Out of what? We don't have anything.

42
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,250
All of our tools and materials are back home.

43
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,250
Alright everyone, empty your pockets.

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,250
Let's see who we've got to work with.

45
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,250
I have a good idea.

46
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,250
Let's go.

47
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,250
Let's go.

48
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Everyone empty your pockets.

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Let's see who we've got to work with.

50
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,712
I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter

51
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,250
last night.

52
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,250
I've got some flint and a piece of string.

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,026
All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that

54
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,250
chicken machine exploded.

55
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,250
Let's see, I've got some flint, steel, sword.

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,250
Oh and some string from a spider that I fought in Windsor.

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,250
String, sticks, flint and feathers.

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,250
Let's go.
