1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're cool with me Lukas.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thanks Jesse.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Me too.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thanks.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,737
If you're alright with them, then I guess I can live with

6
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:10,000
it.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, I'll take that.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright then, let's head out.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Look at that thing.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's get a closer look.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What is this place?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's what we're trying to figure out.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lukas, are you sure?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He's right, look.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you think they're in there?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's go in and find out.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's just all be careful.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,714
If you spot anything, call it out. We don't have a lot of

24
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:16,000
time.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,581
Isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to look like

26
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,000
spooky little faces?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What do you dispense little guy?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I get the feeling that we don't really want to find out.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Get behind me.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What was that?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's probably not a good thing.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh come on dispenser faces.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought we were friends.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Run!

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We're trapped!

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We activated the dispensers with that pressure plate.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,789
If we can figure out a way to trigger it again, I bet

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,000
that'll shut them off.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,606
There's a crafting table, maybe we can make something

40
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:04,000
useful.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Out of what? We don't have anything.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All of our tools and materials are back home.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Alright everyone, empty your pockets.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's see who we've got to work with.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have a good idea.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's go.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everyone empty your pockets.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's see who we've got to work with.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,462
I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter

51
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:26,000
last night.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've got some flint and a piece of string.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,776
All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that

54
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,000
chicken machine exploded.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's see, I've got some flint, steel, sword.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh and some string from a spider that I fought in Windsor.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
String, sticks, flint and feathers.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go.
