1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
What’s in it for me?

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,303
Respect. Admiration.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,500
Not getting punched in the face for saying that just now.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,050
You just keep a crafting table down here?

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,200
Comes in handy.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,086
Since that wooden sword of yours got busted…

7
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:19,354
You’re giving me a new one?

8
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:21,600
Even better. You can make your own.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,000
One stick, plus two stones, equals one sword.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,800
Just grab what you need.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,950
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,134
Hey, is all this stuff yours?

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:36,800
No, we’re just stealing from whoever was dumb enough to leave this here.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,350
Of course it’s mine.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,900
Just making sure.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,350
Oh, her
