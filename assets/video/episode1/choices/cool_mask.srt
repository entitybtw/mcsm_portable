00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Cool mask!

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,300
It IS, isn’t it?

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,700
Yeah! Very convincing!

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,950
Hahaha!

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,000
The look on your faces!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Did you bring the fireworks?

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Of course I did!

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,900
I even brought something for the little guy!

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,600
Nice!

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,500
You brought Reuben a disguise?

11
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Umm… We’re going to a convention!

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
SOMEBODY’s gotta wear a costume!

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
He looks AWESOME!

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It only took me like a million hours to build it.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Alright. Alright.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You definitely brought the fireworks, right?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeeesss! I’m ready! Waiting on you guys!

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If he was REALLY your best friend, you wouldn’t let him go outside dressed like that…

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,750
The only thing more dangerous than putting a costume ON a pig, is trying to take OFF.

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,500
Hurry up and grab your stuff!

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
We’ll meet you downstairs, okay?

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay!

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hmmm… flint and steel, not too shabby…

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
One of these days, we’re gonna WIN, the Endercon building competition.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
And WHEN do, people will look up at us and say...

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,500
“Hey, there goes Jesse and Reuben, winners of the Endercon building competition!”

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
They really should change the name…

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Give me a dragon roar, Reuben!

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That’ll do, Reuben! That’ll do!

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
That’s everything.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,768
Let’s roll!

32
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,869
Let’s roll!

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,500
Yeah, dude! “Roll”!

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:51,000
I heard a pretty juicy rumor about the building competition, but you guys have to PROMISE not say anything.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
ALSO it’s in two parts! Each part more exciting than the last!

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
Spit it out, Axel!

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Part one. The special guest of this year’s Endercon is none other than Gabriel The Warrior him-freaking-self.

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
WOAH! What’s part two?!

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,200
Part TWO. According to my sources, the winner of the building competition is gonna get to meet him.
