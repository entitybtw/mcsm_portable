1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Cool mask.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
It is, isn't it?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, very convincing.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Ha ha ha.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Look on your faces.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Did you bring the fireworks?

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Of course I did.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
I even brought something for the little guy.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Nice.

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
You brought Reuben a disguise?

11
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Um, we're going to do a convention.

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Somebody's gonna wear a costume.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
He looks awesome.

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It only took me like a million hours to build it.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Alright, alright.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You definitely brought the fireworks, right?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Yes, I'm ready.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Waiting on you guys.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If he was really your best friend,

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you wouldn't let him go outside dressed like that.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,270
The only thing more dangerous than putting a costume on a

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,500
pig

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
is trying to take it off.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Hurry up and grab your stuff.

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
We'll meet you downstairs, okay?

26
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Hmm, flint and steel, not too shabby.

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,746
One of these days, we're gonna win the Endercon Building

29
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:04,500
Competition.

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
And when we do, people will look at us and say,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
hey, there goes Jesse and Ruben,

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
winners of the Endercon Building Competition.

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
They really should change the name.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Give me a dragon roar, Ruben.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
That'll do, Ruben.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
That'll do.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
That's everything.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's roll.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, dude.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Roll. Let's go.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I heard a pretty juicy rumor about the building competition,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but you guys have to promise not to say anything.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Also, it's in two parts.

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Each part more exciting than the last.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Spit it out, Axel.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,371
Part one, the special guest at this year's Endercon is none

48
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,000
other than

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,370
the guy who's gonna be the winner of the building

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,000
competition.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the winner of the building competition is

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,950
Part one, the special guest at this year's Endercon is none

53
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,500
other than

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Gabriel, the warrior, himself.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Whoa, what's part two?

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Part two, according to my sources,

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,761
the winner of the building competition's gonna get to meet

58
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:10,000
him.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It doesn't mean anything if we lose.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,483
But if we win, oh, man, this would make up for all the

61
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:21,000
losing.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm gonna go get some rest.
