1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's do this.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
All right!

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Good job, Jesse.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
This... must be their enchantment room.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Doesn't this look like Ivor's creepy basement?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Find anything useful?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not sure about "useful" but... definitely interesting.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,750
There's a lot of history in this room.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,110
"The battle was fierce, but the Order of the Stone emerged...

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,041
triumphant, saving the land and ensuring that peace and…

11
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,000
prosperity would reign forever."

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, not exactly forever.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,000
"These five members... five friends. Together, would give so much to gain their rightful place, as five heroes."

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,500
"They would author their own end.

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,000
They would slay a dragon."

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ivor was a member of the Order of the Stone?!
