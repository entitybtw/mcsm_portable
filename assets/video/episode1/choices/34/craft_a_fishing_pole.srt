1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's do this.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
All right!

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Good job, Jesse.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
This... must be their enchantment room.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Doesn't this look like Ivor's creepy basement?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Find anything useful?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not sure about "useful" but... definitely interesting.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,750
There's a lot of history in this room.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,110
"The battle was fierce, but the Order of the Stone emerged...

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,041
triumphant, saving the land and ensuring that peace and…

11
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,000
prosperity would reign forever."

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, not exactly forever.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
"These five members... five friends. Together, would give so much to gain their rightful place, as five heroes."

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,500
"They would author their own end.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,000
They would slay a dragon."

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ivor was a member of the Order of the Stone?!
