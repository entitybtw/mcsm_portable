1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All I've got is this sword.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, that's very nice.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
With this I could cut my butchering time in half.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice doin' business with you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
C'mon, Reuben.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm sorry Reuben. I was so busy trying to find that creepy dude, I didn't notice.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Long story short, we met up with this guy.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,300
He cheated me and Petra on a deal, and now we're trying to track him down. You in?

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, I'm in, all right.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Any sign of him?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I thought I saw him earlier, but it was just a false alarm.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Wait! There he is!

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,300
Looks like he's heading towards the Hall.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,000
We're going to have to get past that usher to follow him.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's go!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, yeah, hey...

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,700
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Uh... tickets... hehehe...

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
This might sound crazy, but we're actually on an important mission.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,200
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show. 'Cause otherwise...

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Chickeeeeennnnnn!!!

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Chicken - Chicken - Chicken!

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
It's gone, you're totally fine, you're a totally cool dude.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
We have to do something.

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,000
Like what? This show has been sold out for ages!

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
We need a distraction.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Shoo! shoo! Get outta here!

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
The usher is afraid of chickens...

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,000
What would you say if I told you I wanna break this guy's chicken machine to create the mother of all distractions?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
But you have to break that pane of glass.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
How're you going to reach it?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's look around. There has to be something we can do.
