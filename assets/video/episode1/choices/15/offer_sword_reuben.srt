1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All I've got is this sword.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, that's very nice.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With this, I could cut my butchering time in half.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice doing business with you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Come on, Ruben.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,580
I'm sorry, Ruben. I was so busy trying to find that creepy

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,000
dude, I didn't notice.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,313
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra? Long story

9
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:37,686
short, we met up with this guy. He cheated me and Petra on

10
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:41,000
a deal, and now we're trying to track him down. You in?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, I'm in. Alright.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Any sign of him?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I thought I saw him earlier, but it was just a false alarm.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, there he is! Looks like he's heading towards the hall.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're gonna have to get past that usher to follow him.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's go!

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, yeah, hey.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Uh, tickets?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,462
This might sound crazy, but we're actually on an important

21
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:08,000
mission.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,766
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show, cause I

23
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,000
mean, otherwise...

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,682
It's gone. You're totally fine. You were totally cool doing

26
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,000
it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,041
We have to do something. Like what? This show has been sold

28
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,000
out for ages.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We need a distraction.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Usher is afraid of chickens.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,529
What would you say if I told you I want to break this guy's

34
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:44,000
chicken machine to create the mother of all distractions?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,420
But you have to break that pane of glass. How are you gonna

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,000
reach it?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's look around. There has to be something we can do.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not sure what to do.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not sure what to do.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not sure what to do.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not sure what to do.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not sure what to do.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not sure what to do.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not sure what to do.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not sure what to do.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm not sure what to do.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not sure what to do.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not sure what to do.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not sure what to do.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not sure what to do.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not sure what to do.
