1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Give me back my pig.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright you little maniac, fine.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Take it. It's yours.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Come on Reuben.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,435
Sorry Reuben. I never should have let you run off in the

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,000
woods.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, oh, oh.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wham.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,909
Long story short, we met up with this guy, he cheated me

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,000
and Petra on a deal,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and now we're trying to track him down. You in?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, I'm in alright.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Any sign of him?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I thought I saw him earlier but it was just a false alarm.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wait, there he is. Looks like he's heading towards the hall.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're gonna have to get past that usher to follow him.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's go!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So yeah, hey!

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Uh, tickets?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,597
This might sound crazy, but we're actually on an important

23
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:03,000
mission.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,766
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show, cause I

25
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,000
mean, otherwise...

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,606
It's gone. You're totally fine. You were a totally cool

28
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:17,000
dude.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,232
We have to do something. Like what? This show has been sold

30
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:22,000
out for ages.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We need a distraction.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I sure is afraid of chickens.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,025
What would you say if I told you I want to break this guy's

36
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,000
chicken machine to create the mother of all distractions?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,420
But you have to break that pane of glass. How are you gonna

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,000
reach it?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's look around. There has to be something we can do.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure what to do.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure what to do.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure what to do.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure what to do.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure what to do.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure what to do.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure what to do.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure what to do.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not sure what to do.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not sure what to do.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not sure what to do.
