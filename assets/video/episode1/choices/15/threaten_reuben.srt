1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Give. Me. Back. My. Pig.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, you little maniac, fine. Take him, he's yours.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
C'mon, Reuben.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry Reuben. I was so busy trying to find that creepy dude, I didn't notice.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Long story short, we met up with this guy.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,300
He cheated me and Petra on a deal, and now we're trying to track him down. You in?

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, I'm in, all right.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Any sign of him?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought I saw him earlier, but it was just a false alarm.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Wait! There he is!

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,300
Looks like he's heading towards the Hall.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to have to get past that usher to follow him.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go!

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, yeah, hey...

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,700
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Uh... tickets... hehehe...

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
This might sound crazy, but we're actually on an important mission.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,200
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show. 'Cause otherwise...

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,500
Chickeeeeennnnnn!!!

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Chicken - Chicken - Chicken!

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
It's gone, you're totally fine, you're a totally cool dude.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,300
We have to do something.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
Like what? This show has been sold out for ages!

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
We need a distraction.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Shoo! shoo! Get outta here!

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
The usher is afraid of chickens...

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,000
What would you say if I told you I wanna break this guy's chicken machine to create the mother of all distractions?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
But you have to break that pane of glass.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
How're you going to reach it?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's look around. There has to be something we can do.
