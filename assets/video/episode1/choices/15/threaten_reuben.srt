1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Give me back my pig.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright you little maniac, fine.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Take a look.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He's yours.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come on Ruben.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,275
I'm sorry Ruben, I was so busy trying to find that creepy

7
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,000
dude, I didn't notice.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Flem.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,982
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra? Long story

10
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:35,017
short, we met up with this guy, he cheated me and Petra on

11
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:38,000
a deal, and now we're trying to track him down. You in?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh I'm in alright.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Any sign of him?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought I saw him earlier but it was just a false alarm.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait, there he is! It's like he's heading towards the hall.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're gonna have to get past that usher to follow him.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go!

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So yeah, hey.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Uh, tickets?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,590
This might sound crazy but we're actually on an important

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,000
mission.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,815
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show, cause I

24
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:10,000
mean otherwise...

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's gone, you're totally fine, you were totally cold.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We have to do something.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Like what? This show has been sold out for ages.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We need a distraction.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Not sure he's afraid of chickens.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,025
What would you say if I told you I want to break this guy's

34
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:41,000
chicken machine to create the mother of all distractions?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,420
But you have to break that pane of glass. How are you gonna

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,000
reach it?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's look around, there has to be something we can do.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks for watching!
