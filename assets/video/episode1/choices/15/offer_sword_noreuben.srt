1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All I've got is this sword.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, that's very nice.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With this, I could cut my butchering time in half.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice doing business with you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Come on, Ruben.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,507
I'm sorry, Ruben. I never should have let you run off in

7
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:22,000
the woods.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Remember that thing I had to go do with Petra?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Long story short, we met up with this guy.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,351
He cheated me and Petra on a deal, and now we're trying to

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,000
track him down.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You in?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, I'm in. All right.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Any sign of him?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought I saw him earlier, but it was just a false alarm.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wait, there he is!

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Looks like he's heading towards the hall.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're gonna have to get past that usher to follow him.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's go!

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, yeah, hey...

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What would it take to get us inside tonight?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Uh, tickets?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,597
This might sound crazy, but we're actually on an important

24
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,000
mission.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I hope your mission came with tickets to the show,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because, I mean, otherwise...

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Chicken!

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's gone. You're totally fine.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You were totally cool to get.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We have to do something.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Like what? This show has been sold out for ages.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We need a distraction.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A lot of chickens running around might be a distraction.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Usher is afraid of chickens.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,146
What would you say if I told you I want to break this guy's

38
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:38,000
chicken machine

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to create the mother of all distractions?

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But you have to break that pane of glass.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How are you gonna reach it?

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's look around. There has to be something we can do.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure what to do.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure what to do.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure what to do.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure what to do.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure what to do.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not sure what to do.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not sure what to do.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not sure what to do.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not sure what to do.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not sure what to do.
