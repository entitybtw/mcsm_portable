1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
This might explain why Ivor had such a grudge against Gabriel.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
They lied to us. They lied to the whole world.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Why would they do this?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,700
This is so... crazy.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,700
The Order might not be what we thought they were, but Petra is still out there.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,700
The monster is still out there.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
Jesse's right. We need to focus on what we came here to do.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,950
Where do these stairs go?

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,450
Only one way to find out.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Now this is cool.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Wow.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
What happened to the walls?

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,700
More like, what happened to this whole place?

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,700
This must have been where they met.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
So where are they then?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,700
Gabriel said that once we find the temple, the amulet would lead us to the Order of the Stone.

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Well, what are you waiting for? Pull it out then.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,700
Is... something supposed to happen?

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, that was a let down.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,750
There's got to be something we're missing.

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,000
Look around and see if you can find anything.
