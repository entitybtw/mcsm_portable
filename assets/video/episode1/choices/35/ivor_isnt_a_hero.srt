1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
There must be a reason he's never been mentioned.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Maybe he was different back then.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Maybe they kicked him out.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,300
This is so... crazy.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,300
The Order might not be what we thought they were, but Petra is still out there.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
The monster is still out there.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,300
Jesse's right. We need to focus on what we came here to do.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,550
Where do these stairs go?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,050
Only one way to find out.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Now this is cool.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
Wow.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
What happened to the walls?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
More like, what happened to this whole place?

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
This must have been where they met.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,300
So where are they then?

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,300
Gabriel said that once we find the temple, the amulet would lead us to the Order of the Stone.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
Well, what are you waiting for? Pull it out then.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,300
Is... something supposed to happen?

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,600
Well, that was a let down.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,350
There's got to be something we're missing.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,600
Look around and see if you can find anything.
