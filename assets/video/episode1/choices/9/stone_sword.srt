1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,600
See, isn’t it better when you make it yourself?

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,100
Check it out… Endercon’s all lit up.

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,100
I can’t believe it… we won!

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,900
Good for you, Jesse.

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,950
It’s about time we beat Lukas and his gang of jerks!

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,050
What kind of stupid name is the Ocelots, anyway?

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,750
You know, Lukas may be kind of arrogant, but he has come through for me in tricky situations.

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,100
You might wanna get to know him… just in case.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,350
Yeah, you might be right

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,550
I’m just saying, if you run into him at Endercon… try to talk to him.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,150
I don’t need a lecture on the power of collaboration, Petra.

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,973
How 'bout a lecture on the power of my fist?

13
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,250
It’s short. But deadly.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,100
C’mon… let’s hurry.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,500
Remember what Endercon was like BEFORE it was cool?

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,850
Remember what WE were like before WE were cool?

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,954
…some of us will never be cool.

18
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:11,500
Ha-ha.

19
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,200
Creepers!

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
This… doesn’t look good.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,612
Well… there’s only one way off this bridge.
