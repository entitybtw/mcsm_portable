00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,177
Jesse, a lever's not gonna do you much in a fight, is it?

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,100
See, isn’t it better when you make it yourself?

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,600
Check it out… Endercon’s all it up.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
I can’t believe it… we won!

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,400
Good for you, Jesse.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,450
It’s about time we beat Lukas and his gang of jerks!

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,550
What kind of stupid name is the Ocelots, anyway?

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,250
You know, Lukas may be kind of arrogant, but he has come through for me in tricky situations.

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,600
You might wanna get to know him… just in case.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,850
Yeah, you might be right

11
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,050
I’m just saying, if you run into him at Endercon… try to talk to him.

12
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,650
I don’t need a lecture on the power of collaboration, Petra.

13
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,473
How 'bout a lecture on the power of my fist?

14
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,750
It’s short. But deadly.

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,600
C’mon… let’s hurry.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Remember what Endercon was like BEFORE it was cool?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,350
Remember what WE were like before WE were cool?

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,454
…some of us will never be cool.

19
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,000
Ha-ha.

20
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,700
Creepers!

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,900
This… doesn’t look good.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,012
Well… there’s only one way off this bridge.
