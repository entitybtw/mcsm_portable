1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,900
Jesse, a lever's not gonna do you much good in a fight, is

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,480
it?

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
See? Isn't it better when you make it yourself?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Check it out. Endercons all lit up.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
I can't believe it. We won!

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
Good for you, Jesse.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,955
It's about time we beat Lucas and his gang of jerks. What

8
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:51,360
kind of stupid name is the Ocelots, anyway?

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,730
You know, Lucas may be kind of arrogant, but he has come

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,640
through for me in tricky situations.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,240
You might want to get to know him. Just in case.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
Yeah, you might be right.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,808
I'm just saying, if you run into him at Endercon, try

14
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:07,680
talking to him.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,360
I don't need a lecture on the power of collaboration, Petra.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,488
How about a lecture on the power of my fists? It's short,

17
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:16,240
but deadly.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,920
Come on, let's hurry.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
Remember what Endercon was like before it was cool?

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
Remember what we were like before we were cool?

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
Some of us will never be cool.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Ha ha.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,200
Creepers!

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
This doesn't look good.

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
Well, there's only one way off this bridge.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
Whatever we do, we do it together.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up, Jesse!
