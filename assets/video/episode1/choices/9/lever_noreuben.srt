1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,863
Jesse, a lever's not gonna do you much good in a fight, is

2
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,440
it?

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
See? Isn't it better when you make it yourself?

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Check it out. Endercons all lit up.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I can't believe it. We won!

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Good for you, Jesse.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,915
It's about time we beat Lucas and his gang of jerks. What

8
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,320
kind of stupid name is the Ocelots, anyway?

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,810
You know, Lucas may be kind of arrogant, but he has come

10
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,800
through for me in tricky situations.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,520
You might want to get to know him. Just in case.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Yeah, you might be right.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,032
I'm just saying, if you run into him at Endercon, try

14
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:07,960
talking to him.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,360
I don't need a lecture on the power of collaboration, Petra.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,304
How about a lecture on the power of my fists? It's short,

17
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,000
but deadly.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Come on, let's hurry.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Remember what Endercon was like before it was cool?

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Remember what we were like before we were cool?

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Some of us will never be cool.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Ha ha.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Creepers!

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
This doesn't look good.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Well, there's only one way off this bridge.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whatever we do, we do it together.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Hurry up, Jesse!
