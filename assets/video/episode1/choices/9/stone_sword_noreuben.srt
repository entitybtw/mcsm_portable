1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
See? Isn't it better when you make it yourself?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Check it out. Endercons all lit up.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't believe it. We won.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good for you, Jesse.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,386
It's about time we beat Lucas and his gang of jerks. What

6
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,000
kind of stupid name is the Ocelots, anyway?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,943
You know, Lucas may be kind of arrogant, but he has come

8
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:43,028
through for me in tricky situations. You might want to get

9
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:45,000
to know him. Just in case.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, you might be right.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm just saying, if you run into him at Endercon, try

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
talking to him.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't need a lecture on the power of collaboration, Petra.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,130
How about a lecture on the power of my fists? It's short,

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,000
but deadly.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come on, let's hurry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Remember what Endercon was like before it was cool?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Remember what we were like before we were cool?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Some of us will never be cool.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ha ha.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Creepers!

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This doesn't look good.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, there's only one way off this bridge.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Whatever we do, we do it together.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hurry up, Jesse!
