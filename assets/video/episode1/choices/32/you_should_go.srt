1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Be careful out there. Always am.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,454
Add up all the times he was a jerk to us and this doesn't

3
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:16,000
compare.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,068
You're being ridiculous. And if anything happens to him,

5
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm blaming you.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I didn't know it would rain.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You feeling good about yourself?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He'll be fine.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, guys. I picked some apples.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are more than welcome with some if you want.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thanks, Lukas.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You got up early and did all this?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I figured we have to eat.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I thought you left.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, me too. I got a tower up as fast as I could.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I tried to do some thinking, but it was too cold.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then it started raining.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, it's alright. It's just...

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's been a long night.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm resourceful, you know? People always say that.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I am a good friend.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Most of the time, I'm a good friend.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,352
Now yesterday I wasn't at my best for one second and it's

25
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,000
like, none of that matters.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Except for one thing.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Petra still needs us.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I let her down once.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It won't happen again.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're in this together now.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm with you guys.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
To the end.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not really used to having to invite myself along.
