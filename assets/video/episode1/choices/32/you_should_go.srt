1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Be careful out there.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Totally am!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Add up all the times he was a jerk to us, and this doesn't compare.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're being ridiculous. And if anything happens to him, I'm blaming you.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I didn't know it would rain.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You feeling good about yourself?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He'll be fine.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, guys. I, um... I picked some apples.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're more than welcome to some if you want.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thanks, Lukas.

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,000
You got up early and did all this?

12
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,500
I figure we have to eat.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,750
I thought you left.

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah. Me too. I got a tower up as fast as I could.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I tried to do some thinking... but it was too cold…

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then it started raining.

17
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,000
No, it's all right. It's just...

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's been a long night.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm resourceful, y'know? People always say that.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I'm a good friend.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Most of the time. I'm a good friend.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,352
Yesterday I wasn't at my best for one second and it's like... none of that matters.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Except for one thing...

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Petra still needs us.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
I let her down once.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It won't happen again.
