1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,702
You're not going anywhere.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,702
But Jesse...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
That's enough. We're all on the same team now. He's staying.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Zombie-sized chickens. That's what I'd fight.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Why's that?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
'Cause I'm starving.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Thanks for keeping me around, Jesse.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Yeah.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Sorry about all that business last night.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,000
Honestly, I'm just... I'm more embarrassed than anything else.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,500
See anything?

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Hey! There's something over that way!

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What is it?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Some kind of building. I think.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,750
Let's get a closer look.

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,250
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
What is this place?

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
That's what we're trying to figure out.

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone.

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Lukas, are you sure?

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
He's right! Look.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Do you think they're in there?

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Let's go in and find out.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Let's just all be careful.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
If you spot anything, call it out. We don't have a lot of time.

27
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Isn't it weird how dispenser are carved to look like spooky little faces?

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,000
What do you dispense, little guy?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Iiii get the feeling that we don't really wanna find out.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,750
Get behind me.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
What was that?

32
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,500
That's probably not a good thing.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Aw, come on, dispenser faces!

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I thought we were friends!

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,250
Run!

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
We're trapped!

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
We activated the dispensers with that pressure plate.

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
If we can figure out a way to trigger it again, I'll bet that'll shut'em off.

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
There's a crafting table. Maybe we can make something useful.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
What do you mean? We don't have anything.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
All of our tools and materials are back home.

42
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
All right everyone. Empty your pockets.

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's see what we've got to work with.

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter last night.

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I've got some flint.

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
And... a piece of string.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,500
All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that chicken machine exploded.

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's see... I've got some flint and steel.

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
A sword.

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Oh, and some string from a spider that I fought in the woods earlier.

51
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
String, sticks, flint and feathers.
