1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,702
You're not going anywhere. But Jesse, that's enough. We're

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:06,000
all on the same team now. You stay.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Zombie-sized chickens. That's what I would fight.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Why's that?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Because I'm starving.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Thanks for keeping me around, Jesse.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Yeah.

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Sorry about all that business last night.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,016
Honestly, I'm just... I'm more embarrassed than anything

10
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:06,500
else.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
See anything?

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Hey! There's something over that way!

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
What is it?

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Some kind of building, I think.

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Let's get a closer look.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
What's that?

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
What is this place?

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
That's what we're trying to figure out.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
What's that?

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I don't know.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't know.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
I don't know.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I don't know.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I don't know.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
I don't know.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I don't know.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I don't know.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
That's what we're trying to figure out.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Lukas, are you sure?

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
He's right. Look.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Do you think they're in there?

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's go in and find out.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's just all be careful.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,214
If you spot anything, call it out. We don't have a lot of

38
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:16,500
time.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,364
Isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to look like

40
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:20,500
spooky little faces?

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
What do you dispense, little guy?

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,500
I get the feeling that we don't really want to find out.

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Get behind me.

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
What was that?

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
That's probably not a good thing.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Oh, come on, dispenser faces.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
What about we're friends?

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Run!

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
We're trapped!

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
We activated the dispensers with that pressure plate.

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,289
If we can figure out a way to trigger it again, I bet

52
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,500
that'll shut them off.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,106
There's a crafting table. Maybe we can make something

54
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:13,500
useful.

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
What do you mean? We don't have anything.

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
All of our tools and materials are back home.

57
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Alright, everyone. Empty your pockets.

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's see what we've got to work with.

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,962
I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter

60
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:25,500
last night.

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I've got some flint and...

62
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
a piece of string.

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,276
All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that

64
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:33,500
chicken machine exploded.

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's see. We've got some flint and steel.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
A sword.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,719
Oh, and some string from a spider that I fought in the

68
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,500
woods around here.

69
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
String, sticks, flint, and feathers.
