1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's build a hut. It won't take as long.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's not.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That's it, Olivia. Jesse made the call.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We should get started.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,597
All that work? And we're still eye level with monsters that

6
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:21,000
are trying to kill us.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's done. It's over. We aren't talking about it anymore.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We could have maybe done like a multi-level thing, but...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's too late now. I mean, it's... it's cool.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's keep it together, guys.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, man!

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,371
I'm going to tell you something. You have to promise not to

14
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:53,000
freak out.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What is it?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have cookies.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
One for me, one for Olivia, one for Jesse.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thanks, Axel.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And one for Ruben.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sorry, Lucas. I only have four.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, no. It's... it's all right. I'm not that hungry anyway.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll just grab something in the morning or something.
