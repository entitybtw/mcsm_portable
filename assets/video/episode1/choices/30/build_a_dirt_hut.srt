1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's build a hut. It won't take as long.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
It's not...

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,500
That's it, Olivia. Jesse made the call.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,000
We should get started.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,000
All that work and we're still eye-level with monsters that are going to try to kill us.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
It's done. It's over. We aren't talking about it anymore.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
We could have maybe done like a multi-level thing, but...

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
It's too late now. I mean, it's... it's cool.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,700
Let's keep it together, guys.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh man!

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
What?

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm going to tell you something, you have to promise not to freak out.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,400
What is it?

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,250
I have cookies.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
One for me...

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
One for Olivia...

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
One for Jesse.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Thanks, Axel.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
And one for Reuben.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorry Lukas, I only have four.
