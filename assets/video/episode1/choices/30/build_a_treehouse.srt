00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Let's go with a treehouse.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
It's functional. It'll keep us out of danger.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
It's not a bad idea.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,200
All right. Fine.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's get started then.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,600
If I wake up with a spider on my face, I'm going to expect you to deal with it.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Lower you expectations, Axel.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Well, maybe if we'd built into the tree a little bit more, it could've...

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Nevermind. It's -- this is fine. It's good!

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,850
Looks good, guys.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh man!

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
What?

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm going to tell you something, you have to promise not to freak out.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,400
What is it?

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,250
I have cookies.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
One for me...

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
One for Olivia...

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
One for Jesse.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Thanks, Axel.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
And one for Reuben.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorry Lukas, I only have four.
