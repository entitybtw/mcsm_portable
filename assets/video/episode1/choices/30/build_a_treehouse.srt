1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Let's go with the treehouse.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
It's functional. It'll keep us out of danger.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
It's not a bad idea.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Alright, fine.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's get started then.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,615
If I wake up with a spider on my face, I'm gonna expect you

7
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:23,600
to deal with it.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Lower your expectations, Axel.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,501
Well, maybe if we'd built into the tree a little bit more,

10
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,200
it could've...

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Never mind. It's... This is fine. It's good.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Looks good, guys.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh, man.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
What?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,571
I'm going to tell you something. You have to promise not to

16
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,200
freak out.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,400
What is it?

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
I have cookies.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
One for me...

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
One for Olivia...

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
One for Jesse.

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Thanks, Axel.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
And one for Reuben.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorry, Lukas. I only have four.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Oh, no. It's... It's alright.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm not that hungry anyway.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll just...

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Grab something in the morning, or something.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
I'll just...

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,000
Grab something in the morning, or something.
