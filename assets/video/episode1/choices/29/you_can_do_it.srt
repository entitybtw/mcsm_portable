1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can do it, Axel.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
That's right, I can do it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Whatever's on the other side has no idea when it's got coming.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright, here I go. Thanks, Jesse.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right behind you.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Be safe up there, Axel.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ready or not, here I come.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,750
Get off of me!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,750
Oh, man. That was close.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm never going first again.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Where are we?

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
In the dark; in the middle of nowhere.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Maybe we should bed down for the night.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,750
It's dangerous to be out when it's this dark

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,500
I thought we were headed toward the temple.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,750
We're looking for a giant building. It should be pretty obvious.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,500
Ivor said...

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Ohhh. "Ivor said". Well, then maybe this is the temple.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Take it easy, Axel.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,100
He called me stupid.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,500
No, I didn't.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,900
But you wanted to.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,100
No, I didn't.

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,100
Huh? Did you say something?

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,200
We have to build a shelter.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,400
I thought that was what I said, but… uh...

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Yup. That's totally... It's getting dark and stuff.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I say we build a treehouse.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,100
That'll take forever. And we'll be exposed while we do it.

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,000
We just need a quick and dirty hut.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,883
Look, whatever it is? We gotta do it fast.
