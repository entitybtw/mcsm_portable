1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I'll go first.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,500
That's not what I was saying.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm going.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, if you absolutely insist.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Well -- see you guys on the other side, I guess.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Be careful.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Thanks Jesse.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay... Not what I was expecting.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Oh man. That was close.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
There was a zombie.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh... Is it dead? I mean, you know, dead-dead?

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Where are we?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In the dark; in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
Maybe we should bed down for the night.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,250
It's dangerous to be out when it's this dark

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,000
I thought we were headed toward the temple.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,250
We're looking for a giant building. It should be pretty obvious.

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,000
Ivor said...

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Ohhh. "Ivor said". Well, then maybe this is the temple.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,300
Take it easy, Axel.

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,600
He called me stupid.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,100
No, I didn't.

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,500
But you wanted to.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,600
No, I didn't.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Huh? Did you say something?

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
We have to build a shelter.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,900
I thought that was what I said, but… uh...

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,500
Yup. That's totally... It's getting dark and stuff.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I say we build a treehouse.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,600
That'll take forever. And we'll be exposed while we do it.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,500
We just need a quick and dirty hut.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,383
Look, whatever it is? We gotta do it fast.
