1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Redstone Wrap.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And just like that, I'm nervous again.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't talk like that. We can do this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This year, we can't lose.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's do it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Building starts...

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh no! A fireworks dispenser! I'm so scared!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You worry about your build, and we'll worry about ours.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And now, the moment of truth.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here goes nothing.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This looks so cool. We'll win this for sure.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I gotta admit, this enemy is sweet.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Good call, Jesse.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're gonna win this.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're gonna win this.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good build, man.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What? No way.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh no! Reuben's on fire!

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Reuben, no! Come back!

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The lava's getting closer.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Where's the build?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Reuben's going to get lost.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You guys stay and save the build. On it.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We've got to cover, Jesse. Be careful.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll meet up with you at Endercon.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Reuben, where are you, buddy?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just oink if you can hear me.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, so now you get to choose where to go.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go ahead, select a location.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to go to the end of the road.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to go to the end of the road.
