1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Warrior Whip.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And just like that, I'm nervous again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't talk like that. We can do this.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This year, we can't lose.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's do it.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Building starts now!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh no! A fireworks dispenser! I'm so scared!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You worry about your build and we'll worry about ours.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And now, the moment of truth.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here goes nothing.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This looks so cool. We'll win this for sure.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I gotta admit, this Enderman is sweet.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Good call, Jesse.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good go!

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No way.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh no! Reuben's on fire!

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Reuben, no! Come back!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The lava's getting closer.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where's the build?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Reuben's going to get lost.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You guys stay and save the build.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We've got it covered, Jesse.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We're going to get lost.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You guys stay and save the build.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We've got it covered, Jesse. Be careful.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll meet up with you at EnderCon.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Reuben, where are you, buddy?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just oink if you can hear me.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, so now you get to choose where to go.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Go ahead, select a location.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to go to the end of the tunnel.
