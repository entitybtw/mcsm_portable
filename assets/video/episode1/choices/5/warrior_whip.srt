1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The "Warrior Whip!"

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Aaaand just like that, I’m nervous again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don’t talk like that! We can do this! Just stick to the plan and everything will be fine.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
This year, we can't lose!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's do it.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Building... starts... now!

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, no! A fireworks dispenser?! I’m soooo scared!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,300
You worry about your build and we’ll worry about ours.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,900
And now, the moment of truth.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Here goes nothing…

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,200
This looks so cool. We’ll win this for sure.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,300
I gotta admit, this Enderman is sweet! Good call, Jesse.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Guys, people are looking at us.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,623
Good build, man!

15
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,400
What?

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
No way...

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's just a bunch of dyed wool!?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, no! Reuben's on fire!

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Reuben, no! Come back!

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,800
The lava's getting closer!

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,500
It's gonna ruin the build!

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Reuben's going to get lost!

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
You guys stay and save the build.

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,100
On it!

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
We've got it covered, Jesse. Be careful.

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
We’ll meet up with you at Endercon!

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Reuben?! Where are you?

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Just give me an oink if you can hear me.
