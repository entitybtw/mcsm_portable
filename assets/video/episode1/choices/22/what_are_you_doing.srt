1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ivor, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,400
No need to be alarmed, my friends. I have an elixir that will destroy this creature.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
That potion -- is that...?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh-oh...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Uh, what?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,400
It should have worked -- I took such care!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Axel! You've got to throw the real potion!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
But -- finders, keepers!

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,500
You thieves! You're ruining everything!

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Axel, come on!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Jesse -- throw it!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's protecting itself!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Without the command block exposed... The potion is useless!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,300
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ivor! You coward, come back here!

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Jesse, help me!

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you. Ivor was right about one thing...

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't defeat that thing.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Not on my own. Everyone's running away...

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Except for you. Will you help me?

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Of course!

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Follow me!

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Out of my way, chickens!

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait!

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hey! I'm up here!

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Somebody help me!

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Guys!
