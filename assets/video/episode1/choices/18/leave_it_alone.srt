1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Come on Axel, make yourself useful. Go find that skull.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I am.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,607
Nope, you're literally doing the exact opposite of what I

4
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:10,000
just asked you to do.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's no way he won't notice his fancy potion is missing.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A good thief always covers his tracks.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fixed it.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh yeah, the perfect crime.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey Reuben, find any clues?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is it buddy, you smell something?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Something over there? Good work Reuben.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What is all this stuff?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Soul sand. It was everywhere in the nether.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What about that block in the middle?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've never seen one of these before.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I wonder if I just take a closer look.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't touch that Olivia.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was just curious.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't forget what we're here for. Find that skull.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, good news, weird news.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I found the skull, but...

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,602
Why'd I risk my neck for that skull if he's got two of them

23
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:18,000
already?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Maybe Ivor is some kind of collector. A trophy hunter.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Or he could be collecting them to make a bunch of banners.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think I know what's going on here.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Soul sand plus three wither skulls.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's the recipe for a wither.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But, oh, wither? That's...

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One of the worst monsters there is.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We came down here to find the skull. Well, we found it.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,352
Maybe we should just grab it and get out of here while we

33
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:46,000
still can.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Guys!

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Scanner!

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Scanner!

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't you recognize me?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Surprised to see me?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, that's not good.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thought you were rid of me, didn't you?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's better.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What was that?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who's there?
