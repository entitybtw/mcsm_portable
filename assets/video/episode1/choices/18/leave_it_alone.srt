00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
C'mon Axel -- make yourself useful and go find that skull.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I am…

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Uh, nope. You're literally doing the exact opposite of what I just asked you to do.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's no way he won't notice his fancy potion is missing.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A good thief always covers his tracks.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,500
Fixed it!

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh yeah, the perfect crime.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey, Reuben. Find any clues?

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,800
What it is, buddy? You smell something?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,800
Something over there? Good work, Reuben!

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,000
What the hell is all this stuff?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Soul Sand. It was everywhere in the Nether.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,250
What about that block in the middle?

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,000
I've never seen one of these before…

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,700
I wonder if I just -- take a closer look…

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't touch it, Olivia!

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,700
I was just curious.

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,850
Don't forget what we're for -- find that skull.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sooooooo.... Good news, weird news.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I found the skull, but...

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why'd I risk my neck for that skull if he's got two of them already?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Maybe Ivor's some kind of collector, a trophy hunter.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Or he could be collecting them to make a bunch of banners.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think I know what's going on here.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Soul Sand, plus three Wither skulls…

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's the recipe for a Wither.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But... A Wither... That's --

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One of the worst monsters there is.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We came down here to find the skull. Well, we found it.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,250
Maybe we should just grab it, and get out of here -- while we still can.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Uh, guys?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Scatter!

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't you recognize me?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Surprised to see me?

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, that's not good…

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thought you were rid of me, didn't you?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's better.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,950
What was that?

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,850
Who's there?
