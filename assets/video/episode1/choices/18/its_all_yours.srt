1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's yours, if you want it that bad.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,250
I've never wanted anything bad-er!

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,750
There's no way he won't notice his fancy potion is missing.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,750
A good thief always covers his tracks.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,250
Fixed it!

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,750
Oh yeah, the perfect crime.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,750
Hey, Reuben. Find any clues?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,550
What it is, buddy? You smell something?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,550
Something over there? Good work, Reuben!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,750
What the hell is all this stuff?

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,550
Soul Sand. It was everywhere in the Nether.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,000
What about that block in the middle?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,750
I've never seen one of these before…

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,450
I wonder if I just -- take a closer look…

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,750
Don't touch it, Olivia!

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,450
I was just curious.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,600
Don't forget what we're for -- find that skull.

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,750
Sooooooo.... Good news, weird news.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,750
I found the skull, but...

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,750
Why'd I risk my neck for that skull if he's got two of them already?

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,750
Maybe Ivor's some kind of collector, a trophy hunter.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,750
Or he could be collecting them to make a bunch of banners.

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,750
I think I know what's going on here.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Soul Sand, plus three Wither skulls…

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,750
That's the recipe for a Wither.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,750
But... A Wither... That's --

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,750
One of the worst monsters there is.

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,750
We came down here to find the skull. Well, we found it.

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,000
Maybe we should just grab it, and get out of here -- while we still can.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,750
Uh, guys?

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,750
Scatter!

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,750
Don't you recognize me?

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,750
Wait.

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,750
Surprised to see me?

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,750
No, that's not good…

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Thought you were rid of me, didn't you?

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,750
That's better.

39
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,700
What was that?

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,600
Who's there?
