1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That wasn't funny, Axel!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I brought you good times, and now I’m being punished for it?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
You scared us half to death!

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Did you bring the fireworks?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Of course I did!

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,400
I even brought something for the little guy!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,100
Nice!

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,000
You brought Reuben a disguise?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Umm… We’re going to a convention!

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
SOMEBODY’s gotta wear a costume!

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,000
He looks AWESOME!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It only took me like a million hours to build it.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Alright. Alright.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
You definitely brought the fireworks, right?

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeeesss! I’m ready! Waiting on you guys!

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
If he was REALLY your best friend, you wouldn’t let him go outside dressed like that…

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,250
The only thing more dangerous than putting a costume ON a pig, is trying to take OFF.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,000
Hurry up and grab your stuff!

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We’ll meet you downstairs, okay?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Okay!

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Hmmm… flint and steel, not too shabby…

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
One of these days, we’re gonna WIN, the Endercon building competition.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
And WHEN do, people will look up at us and say...

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,000
“Hey, there goes Jesse and Reuben, winners of the Endercon building competition!”

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They really should change the name…

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Give me a dragon roar, Reuben!

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
That’ll do, Reuben! That’ll do!

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
That’s everything.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,268
Let’s roll!

30
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:40,369
Let’s roll!

31
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, dude! “Roll”!

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,500
I heard a pretty juicy rumor about the building competition, but you guys have to PROMISE not say anything.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Okay.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,100
ALSO it’s in two parts! Each part more exciting than the last!

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,400
Spit it out, Axel!

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Part one. The special guest of this year’s Endercon is none other than Gabriel The Warrior him-freaking-self.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
WOAH! What’s part two?!

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,700
Part TWO. According to my sources, the winner of the building competition is gonna get to meet him.
