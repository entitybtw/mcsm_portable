1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That wasn't funny, Axel.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I brought you good times and now I'm being punished for it?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
You scared us half to death.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Did you bring the fireworks?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Of course I did.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I even brought something for the little guy.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nice.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You brought Reuben a disguise?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Um, we're going to a convention.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Somebody's gotta wear a costume.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He looks awesome.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It only took me like a million hours to build it.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Alright, alright.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
You definitely brought the fireworks, right?

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Yes, I'm ready.

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Waiting on you guys.

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,229
If he was really your best friend, you wouldn't let him go

18
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,500
outside dressed like that.

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,775
The only thing more dangerous than putting a costume on a

20
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,500
pig is trying to take it off.

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Hurry up and grab your stuff.

22
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
We'll meet you downstairs, okay?

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Okay.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Hmm, flint and steel, not too shabby.

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,597
One of these days, we're going to win the Endercon Building

26
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:01,500
Competition.

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
And when we do, people will look at us and say,

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,371
hey, there goes Jesse and Reuben, winners of the Endercon

29
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:08,500
Building Competition.

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
They really should change the name.

31
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Give me a dragon roar, Reuben.

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
That'll do, Reuben.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
That'll do.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
That's everything.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Let's roll.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Yeah, dude.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Roll.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Let's go.

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I heard a pretty juicy rumor about the building competition,

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
but you guys have to promise not to say anything.

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Okay.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,119
Also, it's in two parts, each part more exciting than the

43
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:52,500
last.

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Spit it out, Axel.

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Part one, the special guest at this year's Endercon

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
is none other than Gabriel the Warrior, him freaking self.

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Whoa, what's part two?

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Part two, according to my sources,

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,052
the winner of the building competition is going to get to

50
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:07,500
meet him.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
It doesn't mean anything if we lose.

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,983
But if we win, oh, man, this would make up for all the

53
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:18,500
losing.
