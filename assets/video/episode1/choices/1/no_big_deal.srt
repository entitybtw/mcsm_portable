1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,855
It's not that big of a deal. Endercon will be fun either

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:04,200
way.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,700
What? Hold on. Let me try that again.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,200
What?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,700
He's right, Jesse. Incredibly. This is a huge deal.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,700
So, does this source of yours make posters for a living?

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,700
Huh?

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah, my source doesn't exist. You guys are my only friends.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Guys, let's stay focused. We have a competition to win.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,400
We never win. And this year we've got Reuben with us.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
We're going to win because...

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,738
Because up to now, we've hated losing. But today, today, my

14
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:44,400
friends,

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
we're going to start learning how to love winning.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,100
That didn't sound as good as it did in my head.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,100
No, no. I'm with that.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
All right.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,781
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're thinking about this all

20
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,100
wrong.

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,452
The point of the building competition isn't just to build

22
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:03,100
something.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,100
We have to do something to get noticed by the judges.

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
Okay then. So how do we do this?

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,176
We don't just build something functional. We build

26
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,100
something fun.

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,100
After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned,

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
then we build something cool on top of it.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
You might be on to something.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,881
If we want to get a reaction out of the judges, you build

31
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,800
something scary.

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
So I say we build a creeper.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Wouldn't an Enderman be better?

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm more scared of Endermen than creepers.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
They both have their moments. They're both pretty scary.

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,800
You
