1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
It’s not THAT big of a deal… Endercon will be fun either way.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,700
What? Hold on, let me try that again…

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,200
WHAT?!

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,700
He’s right, Jesse! Incredibly! This a huge deal!

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,700
Sooo… Does this “source” of yours make posters for a living?

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,700
Huh?

7
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:28,195
Yeah… my source… doesn’t exist.

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,897
You guys are my only friends.

9
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,300
Guys let’s stay focused, we have a competition to win.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,536
We never win, and this year we’ve got Reuben with us.

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,939
We're going to win. Because...

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,264
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,738
Because up to now we've hated losing.

14
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:50,350
But today, today my friends, we're going to start learning how to love winning...

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,719
That didn't sound as good as it did in my head.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,775
No, no. I'm with that.

17
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,490
All right.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,693
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We’re thinking about this all WRONG!

19
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,597
The point of the building competition isn’t just to BUILD something!

20
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,566
We have to DO something to get noticed by the judges!

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,502
Okay, then. So how do we do this?

22
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,370
We don’t just build something functional.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,439
We build something FUN! 

24
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,744
After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned, we then build something cool on top of it!

25
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,336
You might be onto something!

26
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:23,483
If you wanna get a reaction out of the judges, you need to build something scary.

27
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,475
So I say we build a creeper!

28
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,087
Wouldn’t an enderman be better?

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,756
I’m more scared of endermen than creepers.
