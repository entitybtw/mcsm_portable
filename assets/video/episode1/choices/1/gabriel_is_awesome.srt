1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Meeting Gabriel would be a dream and an honor.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Totally. He's awesome.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It would be amazing to meet him.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Reuben better be careful in that costume.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The last time Gabriel saw a dragon, it didn't end well.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, does this source of yours make posters for a living?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Huh?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, my source doesn't exist.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You guys are my only friends.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Guys, let's stay focused. We have a competition to win.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We never win. And this year we've got Reuben with us.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, no.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to win because...

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because up to now, we've hated losing.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,425
But today, today, my friends, we're going to start learning

17
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,000
how to love winning.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That didn't sound as good as it did in my head.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, no, I'm with that.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All right.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,681
Wait a minute, wait a minute. We're thinking about this all

22
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,000
wrong.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,352
The point of the building competition isn't just to build

24
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,000
something.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have to do something to get noticed by the judges.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, then. So how do we do this?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,076
We don't just build something functional. We build

28
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,000
something fun.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,041
After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned, then

30
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,000
we build something cool on top of it.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We might be onto something.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,081
If we want to get a reaction out of the judges, you build

33
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,000
something scary.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I say we build a creeper.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Wouldn't an Enderman be better?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm more scared of Endermen than creepers.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They both have their moments.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Both pretty scary.
