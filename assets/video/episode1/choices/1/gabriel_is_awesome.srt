1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,403
Meeting Gabriel would be a dream and an honor!

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,572
Totally, he’s awesome!

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,000
It’d be amazing to meet him!

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,000
Reuben better be careful in that costume.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Last time Gabriel saw a dragon, it didn’t end well.

6
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:20,701
Sooo… Does this “source” of yours make posters for a living?

7
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,701
Huh?

8
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:28,196
Yeah… my source… doesn’t exist.

9
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,898
You guys are my only friends.

10
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:33,301
Guys let’s stay focused, we have a competition to win.

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,537
We never win, and this year we’ve got Reuben with us.

12
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,940
We're going to win. Because...

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,265
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:42,739
Because up to now we've hated losing.

15
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,351
But today, today my friends, we're going to start learning how to love winning...

16
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,720
That didn't sound as good as it did in my head.

17
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,776
No, no. I'm with that.

18
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:56,291
All right.

19
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,694
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We’re thinking about this all WRONG!

20
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:03,598
The point of the building competition isn’t just to BUILD something!

21
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:06,567
We have to DO something to get noticed by the judges!

22
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,503
Okay, then. So how do we do this?

23
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,371
We don’t just build something functional.

24
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,440
We build something FUN!

25
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:17,745
After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned, we then build something cool on top of it!

26
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,337
You might be onto something!

27
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:23,484
If you wanna get a reaction out of the judges, you need to build something scary.

28
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,476
So I say we build a creeper!

29
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,088
Wouldn’t an enderman be better?

30
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,857
I’m more scared of endermen than creepers.
