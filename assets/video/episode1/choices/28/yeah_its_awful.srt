00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
You know how you have those experiences you remember and reminisce about for the rest of your lives?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Yeah?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
This isn't one of those. Let's never discuss this ever again.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Can you throw up... like, inside your body?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Uh-huh. I know because I just did, about five times.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Wow -- look at this place!

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,750
All these tracks converge at this point. You could probably get anywhere in the world from here.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
There's the portal!

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,500
This is what Gabriel was talking about.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,750
That's our way out.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,500
It must lead back to the surface.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
The surface is also where that creature is.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,500
He's right. We have no idea what we're walking into. It could be dangerous.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Thanks for being so brave, Axel.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
All right. I'm gonna go. I'm going. I'm going right now.
