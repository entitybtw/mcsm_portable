00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,801
Hey, speak for yourselves, you freaky cats. Ruben and I

2
00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:05,400
handled ourselves just fine. Is that right, Ruben?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What? No! You! Scream! Like a piglet.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,500
Guess who did the piglet-like screaming?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's burn them.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Can you throw up, like, inside your body?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Uh-huh. I know, because I just did. About five times.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Wow. Look at this place.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,072
All these tracks converge at this point. You could probably

10
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,000
get anywhere in the world from here.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
There's the portal.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
This is what Gabriel was talking about.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's our way out.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
It must lead back to the surface.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
The surface is also where that creature is.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,666
He's right. We have no idea what we're walking into. It

17
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,000
could be dangerous.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Thanks for being so brave, Axel.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright, I'm gonna go. I'm going. I'm going right now.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Like, right right now.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,000
I just need to make sure I have everything I'll need.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I think I put the, uh, thing over in, uh...
