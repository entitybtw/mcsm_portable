00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey, speak for yourselves, you fraidy cats. Reuben and I handled ourselves just fine. Isn't that right, Reuben?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Pfffft what? No. YOU screamed... like a piglet… is who did the piglet-like screaming.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,750
Can you throw up... like, inside your body?

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,250
Uh-huh. I know because I just did, about five times.

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,750
Wow -- look at this place!

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,000
All these tracks converge at this point. You could probably get anywhere in the world from here.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
There's the portal!

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,750
This is what Gabriel was talking about.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,000
That's our way out.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,750
It must lead back to the surface.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,750
The surface is also where that creature is.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,750
He's right. We have no idea what we're walking into. It could be dangerous.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,750
Thanks for being so brave, Axel.

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,750
All right. I'm gonna go. I'm going. I'm going right now.
