00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
That's easy. I'll take the little tiny... little zombies.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,300
A hundred of them... crawling all over you, with their tiny hands.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,500
All I need is, like, a shovel. I'm telling you, way too easy.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:24,650
Soo... I’ve got a daylight sensor on the roof... And if I did this right, these lamps should turn on once it gets dark.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,000
I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while we're at the building competition.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,500
He's coming with us.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,230
Really?

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,149
What kind of question is that? Of course he is.

9
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:42,705
Okay. I'm not saying he shouldn't come. I'm not... but don't you think it's a little weird that you take him with you everywhere you go?

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,124
Reuben’s my best friend.

11
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,837
I thought I was your best friend.

12
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:48,462
Both of you are!

13
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:52,961
I didn’t mean anything by it. I’m glad he’s coming.

14
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:56,175
I just don’t wanna give people one more reason to call us “losers”.

15
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,150
Who CARES what other people think?!

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,500
I know, I just… it wears your down.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,362
You say you’re not a loser, Olivia! So WIN!

18
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,975
Okay. Fine.

19
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,524
Do you hear that?

20
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,086
Oh, no.

21
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:22,140
Hahaha! Oh, man you guys totally freaked out! That was awe-

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,920
Axel! What’s the matter with you?!

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,099
Great. Now I’m gonna smell like a pig at Endercon.

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,920
I thought we were buddies!
