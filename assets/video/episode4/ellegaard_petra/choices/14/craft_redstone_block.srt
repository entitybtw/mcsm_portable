00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,854
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to

3
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:30,440
go and place these pistons.

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,000
Holy cow, we did it!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Thanks, Jesse.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,760
And thanks for everything you said just before.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
It really helped.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
No problemo.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
It must be this way!

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Run!

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Everybody get on!

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Quick, onto the barge!

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:01:14,560
That was close.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Everyone okay?

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
For the moment.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
I remember something.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Didn't Ellegaardd build a machine like this once?

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Yes, in the nether.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,560
And you were terrified of flying on it!

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
What?

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Stuffin' nonsense.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
No, no, I'm positive.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
You spent the whole ride quivering in terror.
