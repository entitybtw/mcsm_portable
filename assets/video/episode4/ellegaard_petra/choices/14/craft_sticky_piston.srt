1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,482
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to

3
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,800
go and place these pistons.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Holy cow, we did it!

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,850
Thanks, Jesse. And thanks for everything you said just

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,800
before. It really helped.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
No problemo.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
It must be this way!

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Run! Everybody get on! Quick, onto the barge!

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
That was close. Everyone okay?

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
For the moment.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,152
I remember something. Didn't Eligard build a machine like

14
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:01,800
this once?

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Yes, in the past.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
I remember.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I remember.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I remember.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I remember.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I remember.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I remember.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I remember.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I remember.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Did you build a machine like this once?

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Yes, in the nether.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
And you were terrified of flying on it!

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
What? Stuff and nonsense.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
No, no, I'm positive.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
You spent the whole ride quivering in terror.
