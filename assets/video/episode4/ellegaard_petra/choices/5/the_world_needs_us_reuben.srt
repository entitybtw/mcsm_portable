1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The world needs us, Ruben.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,285
So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock, and it's

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,720
up to us to save the rest of it.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,255
Well, maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and

5
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:13,040
a pig, but we have to find a way.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, you wanted help, do you?

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,003
That's what I said, isn't it? Oh, just as you once helped

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:20,560
us before.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,014
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

10
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,120
three of those things now. You say that like it's my fault!

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Sorin!

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
Sorin, you need to listen to me.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Hush! Ivor, for once!

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,562
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

16
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:36,960
reason.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,136
What you don't understand is you are all in very grave

18
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:40,560
danger.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Obviously!

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,768
No, I mean specifically this group. The Weather Storm isn't

21
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,720
acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,720
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,720
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
What?

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,501
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following

26
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:00,720
Jesse!

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
I didn't know.

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
And it's only getting stronger.

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
You don't think I realize that?

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Nothing can stop those things!

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Nothing even hurts them!

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Well, except Enderman.

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,593
We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off of

34
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:14,720
us.

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,929
So, enough of them working together might be able to

36
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:16,720
destroy a Weather Storm entirely!

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,402
Question is, how to bring the Storms and the Endermen

38
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:18,720
together?

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
At least, not from mere mortals.

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
I know, I know.

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
But I don't think we should let them do that.

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.
