00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Guys, check it out.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,518
We used the Pistons, the Redstone, and the TNT to build a

3
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:06,560
TNT launcher.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,742
Then I climb on and you guys blast me all the way into the

5
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:11,680
Witherstorm.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,120
Haha, heck yeah! I love that idea.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh, look out!

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Ahhhh!

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,480
Axle!

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Whoa!

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
I can't hold on!

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,720
I got you!

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
Lukas! You're here!

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Ocelots, distract that Witherstorm!

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
Hey you! Get a load of this!

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Lukas, thank you.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Anything for a friend.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Okay, I'm ready.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Okay, it's finished.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Quick, climb on!

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
And Jesse, I know you can do this.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
We all do.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Thanks guys, it means a lot.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Now go demolish that command block.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Reuben, this is no place for a...

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Please!

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Ahhhhh!

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Ahhhhh!

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Woah!

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
There it is.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
We meet again, command block.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Now it's time to destroy you.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Holy moly!

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
This thing will die!

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Ah!

41
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,195
Reuben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

42
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:22,640
block.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
The tractor beam!

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Hey you!

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Oh no!
