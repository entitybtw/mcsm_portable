00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,587
Guys, check it out. We build a cobblestone ramp, lay down

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:07,174
some track, attach the TNT to the minecart, and launch it

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,000
off the ramp like a rocket!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Heck yeah! I love that idea!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, look out!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Axle!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can't hold on!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I got you!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Lucas! You're here!

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Lucas, thank you!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Anything for a friend.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, it's finished!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Quick, climb on!

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And Jesse, I know you can do this.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We all do.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thanks guys.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a lot.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now go to walls that command want.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ruben, there's no place for him.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wow!

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There it is.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We meet again, command block.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ruben, I think we made it angry.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Holy moly!

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This thing will die!

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,444
Ruben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

34
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:28,000
block.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The tractor beam!

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hey you!

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to kill you!

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to kill you!

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to kill you!

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to kill you!

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to kill you!

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to kill you!
