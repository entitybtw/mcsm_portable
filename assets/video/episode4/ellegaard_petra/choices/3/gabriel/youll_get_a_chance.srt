1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You'll get your chance Gabriel, this fight isn't over yet.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Very well.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,200
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,500
Which is more than I can say for some of us.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh man, Ellie, for a second I almost managed to forget.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
You guys talking about Ellegard?

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,300
I just can't believe she's gone. Doesn't feel real.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,237
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Ellegard's

10
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:41,800
armor.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,300
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,487
She's right. Don't blame yourself kid. I never blame myself

13
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:51,600
for anything.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,100
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,589
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why

16
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,100
is that thing still alive?

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,433
I mean it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,600
a dent in the command block.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,100
So the command block is still out there? Oh great.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
The question is, what do we do?

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,978
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last

24
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:26,600
thing in the universe?

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,600
I need a moment to think.

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,600
Is he always like this?

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
You have no idea.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
That jacket! I recognize it!

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
Lukas always wears that jacket.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,970
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket

31
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,100
when I was thrown from the monster.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
It hurts just to think about.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Hey, hey. It's okay.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,229
I mean, do you think? I thought for sure they were gone,

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,600
but if they were just trapped in the Witherstorm...

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I don't know.
