1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You'll get your chance Gabriel, this fight isn't over yet.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Very well.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,200
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,500
Which is more than I can say for some of us.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh man, Ellie, for a second I almost managed to forget.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
You guys talking about Ellegard?

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,300
I just can't believe she's gone. Doesn't feel real.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,800
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Ellegard's armor.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,300
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,600
She's right. Don't blame yourself kid. I never blame myself for anything.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,100
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,100
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why is that thing still alive?

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,600
I mean it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,100
So the command block is still out there? Oh great.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
The question is, what do we do?

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,600
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,600
I need a moment to think.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,600
Is he always like this?

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
You have no idea.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
That jacket! I recognize it!

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
Lucas always wears that jacket.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,100
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
It hurts just to think about.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Hey, hey. It's okay.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I mean, do you think? I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the Witherstorm...

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I don't know.
