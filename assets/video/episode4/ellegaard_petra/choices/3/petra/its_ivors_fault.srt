1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,938
This isn't your fault. It's Ivor's who wouldn't do

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:04,760
something stupid for a diamond

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,891
But without my help Ivor wouldn't have wouldn't have wanted

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,080
revenge on Gabriel

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,265
Believe me. He would have found another way. I'm gonna do

6
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,580
everything I can to make this right

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,852
Petra I know this isn't easy to hear but you're too sick to

8
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,720
be going anywhere. I'm not that sick

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,428
Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while. I mean it's

10
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:31,780
safe

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Defensible if I say I'm fine, then I'm

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160
Fine

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
You staying here is the right move

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,760
You'll never get better if we keep pushing you but I want

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,700
to be there for you guys. I know you do and you will

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,633
Maybe you're right. It's the right call Jesse. I hope so.

17
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,040
We didn't all make it back though

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Guys it was my fault

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm the one who took elegant armor

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,160
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,766
She's right. Don't blame yourself kid. Hi. Yeah, never

22
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,580
blame myself for anything

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Being emotional is getting us nowhere

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,601
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,080
is that thing still alive?

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,385
The formidable just wasn't strong enough. I mean it ripped

27
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,920
the wither storm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,600
command block

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
So the command block is still out there. Oh

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,840
Great

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,860
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,240
Question is what do we do?

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,590
Why are you asking me am I expected to know every last

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,000
thing in the universe?

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Huh? I need a moment to think

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,440
Is he always like this? Do you have no idea?

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,500
That jacket I recognize it

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,741
Lukas always wears that jacket. No, there were other people

39
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:12,065
wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:12,600
monster

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,860
It hurts just to think about hey, it's okay

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Hey

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,580
Jesse if what Gabriel said is true, I

44
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,277
Mean do you think I thought for sure they were gone, but if

45
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:32,060
they were just tracked in the wither storm
