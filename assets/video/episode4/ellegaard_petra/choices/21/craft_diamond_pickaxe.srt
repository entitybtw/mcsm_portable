1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Awesome! I've never owned a diamond weapon!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just wait till you enchant it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Behold! My enchanted diamond pickaxe!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, that should do the job nicely.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,192
But if you're fighting those wither monsters head on,

6
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,000
you'll want better armor too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,420
I enchanted these for the Order. They're about as strong as

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,000
it comes.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even able to withstand TNT!

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any preference?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, I kinda wanna keep the armor I'm already wearing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I mean, Ellegaard died so I could have it, you know?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Come to think of it, she would have liked that. Very well.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nice weapon, Jesse!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thanks!

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But at least take some for your friends.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sounds good to me.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,908
Let's get back to Soren's fortress and see how the wither

20
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:20,000
storms are doing against those Endermen.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, my poor fortress!

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I see Endermen, so this means the plan's working, right?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,317
Shouldn't the Endermen have dismantled those things by now?

24
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,000
Or am I just confused?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not just you. Something's wrong.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Jesse, over here!

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's going on?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm just wondering if we should go back to the fortress.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not just you. Something's wrong.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Jesse, over here!

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Axle!

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You guys made it!

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nice freakin' armor, by the way.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you still have the amulet?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Safe and sound. That's not the problem.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then what is?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Endermen. They're not angry enough.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,132
I mean, some of them are, but a lot of them are just

40
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,000
standing around moving blocks.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, being Endermen.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,138
Blast! They kept the main wither storm busy, but one of the

43
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,000
smaller ones started attacking us.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And Magnus ran off to fight that thing all by himself.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's fighting a wither storm? Alone?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,131
Yeah, kept saying something about paying for the mistakes

47
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,000
of the past. Whatever that means.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If a fellow member of the Order of the... of the...

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Order of the Stone?

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
...is out there fighting, then I belong out there too.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,672
Gabriel, no! No, I told you you're not who you think you

52
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:44,000
are!

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My name is Gabriel the Warrior!

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And he's running the wrong way.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Without the command block, none of them stands a chance.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Say what now?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll explain later.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fine.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, uh, you guys didn't check on Petra, did you?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, we came straight here.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All alone in that cave? I hope she's alright.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She will be as long as we destroy the command block.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So what's the plan?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, I know we gotta go in there, but...

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do we just go for it, or what?
