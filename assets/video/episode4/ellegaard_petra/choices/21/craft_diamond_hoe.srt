1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Awesome! I've never owned a diamond weapon!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just wait till you enchant it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Behold my enchanted diamond hoe!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, that should do the job nicely.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,192
But if you're fighting those wither monsters head on,

6
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,000
you'll want better armor too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,420
I enchanted these for the Order. They're about as strong as

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,000
it comes.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even able to withstand TNT!

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any preference?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I kinda want to keep the armor I'm already wearing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I mean, Ellegaard died so I could have it, you know?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come to think of it, she would have liked that. Very well.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nice weapon, Jesse!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks!

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But at least take some for your friends.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sounds good to me.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,908
Let's get back to Soren's fortress and see how the wither

20
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:21,000
storms are doing against those Endermen.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, my poor fortress!

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see Endermen, so this means the plan's working, right?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,317
Shouldn't the Endermen have dismantled those things by now?

25
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:47,000
Or am I just confused?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not just you. Something's wrong.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Jesse, over here!

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Axle!

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You guys made it! Nice freakin' armor, by the way.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you still have the amulet?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Safe and sound. That's not the problem.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then what is?

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Endermen. They're not angry enough.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,132
I mean, some of them are, but a lot of them are just

35
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,000
standing around moving blocks.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, being Endermen.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ugh! Blast!

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,390
They kept the main wither storm busy, but one of the

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,000
smaller ones started attacking us.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And Magnus ran off to fight that thing all by himself.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's fighting a wither storm? Alone?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,277
Yep. Kept saying something about paying for the mistakes of

43
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,000
the past. Whatever that means.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If a fellow member of the Order of the... of the, uh...

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Order of the Stone?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is out there fighting, then I belong out there, too.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,758
Gabriel, no, no! I told you, you're not who you think you

48
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:44,000
are!

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My name is Gabriel the Warrior!

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Raaaaaah!

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Man, he's running the wrong way.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Without the command block, none of them stands a chance.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Say what now?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll explain later.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fine.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, uh, you guys didn't check on Petra, did you?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, we came straight here.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All alone in that cave? I hope she's all right.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She will be as long as we destroy the command block.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So what's the plan?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I mean, I know we gotta go in there, but...

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do we just go for it, or what?
