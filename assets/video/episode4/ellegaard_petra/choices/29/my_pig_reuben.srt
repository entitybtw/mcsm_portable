1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
My hero, Reuben the Pig.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
He may have seemed like just a pig to most people,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
but he was so much more.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,500
And at the end of the day, he saved us all.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
For Reuben!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Jesse, this is the Nether Star

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that dropped when the Wither Storm was destroyed.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You want to do the honors?

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh man, this stage is so cool.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ow!

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,000
My friends, I am now pleased to introduce to you...

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
...a new Order of the Storm!

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,500
And so it was that a new Order of the Stone was born.

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,000
One whose adventures were only just beginning.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,772
For though the world had been saved and the command block

16
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:43,500
destroyed,

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
there are many more worlds than just this one.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Thanks for watching!
