1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,308
I couldn't save you things were happening so fast and that

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:05,720
thing was powerful

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Well, thank you for trying

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,411
Sure all that matters is you're with us now and that you're

5
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:16,640
still a fighter the best one I know

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,280
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,660
All right count me in we didn't all make it back though

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys it was my fault

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,068
She's right. You can't blame yourself. Jesse. I'm surprised

12
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,000
he lasted as long as he did

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,772
Being emotional is getting us nowhere. What I want to know

14
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:51,479
is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still

15
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,000
alive?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,712
I mean it ripped the wither storm apart, but it didn't make

18
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,000
a dent in the command block

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh great

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Question is what do we do?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,230
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,000
thing in the universe?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,313
Well, why are you asking me am I expected to know every

25
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,000
last thing in the universe?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I need a moment to think

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is he always like this you have no idea

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Jacket it looks familiar

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lukas always wears that jacket

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,275
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

31
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,000
from that dead monster

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Even thinking about it hurts. Hey, hey, it's okay

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Jesse if what Petra said is true. I mean, do you think I?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,634
Thought for sure they were gone. But if they were just

35
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,000
tracked in the wither storm

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You
