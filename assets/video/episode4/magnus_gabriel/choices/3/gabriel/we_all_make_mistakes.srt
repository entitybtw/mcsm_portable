1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
We've all made mistakes, including Ivor, right?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, nothing's quite that simple.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,100
But I appreciate you saying that.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,500
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Well, you aren't.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,700
You made it back alive.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,800
Which is more than I can say for some of us.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Oh, Magnus. For a second there, I almost managed to forget.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
You guys talking about Magnus?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
I still can't believe he's gone.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
Guys, it was my fault.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm the one who took Magnus' armor.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,600
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Being emotional is getting us nowhere.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
What I want to know is what happened out there today.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,400
Why is that thing still alive?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,200
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,679
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

21
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:12,800
a dent in the command block.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,600
So the command block is still out there?

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, great.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,600
The question is, what do we do?

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Why are you asking me?

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,400
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I need a moment to think.

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,600
Is he always like this?

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,800
You have no idea.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
That jacket, it looks familiar.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Lukas always wears that jacket.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,808
No. I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

34
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:56,700
from that...

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,300
dead monster.

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Even thinking about it hurts.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Hey, hey, it's okay.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,500
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
I mean, do you think?

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
trapped in the witherstorm...
