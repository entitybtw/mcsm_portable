1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Doesn't matter how this started or who started it.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,400
We just have to end it.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,100
You're right. I know you're right.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,600
I only wish I could continue to help.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,100
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
Well, you aren't.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,300
You made it back alive.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,500
Which is more than I can say for some of us.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Oh, Magnus. For a second there, I almost managed to forget.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
You guys talking about Magnus?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I still can't believe he's gone.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Guys, it was my fault.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,500
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Being emotional is getting us nowhere.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,000
What I want to know is what happened out there today.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why is that thing still alive?

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,346
I mean, it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

22
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:12,500
a dent in the command block.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
So the command block is still out there?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, great.

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Question is, what do we do?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Why are you asking me?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
I need a moment to think.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Is he always like this?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You have no idea.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That jacket, it looks familiar.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Lukas always wears that jacket.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,222
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

35
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:57,000
from that dead monster.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Even thinking about it hurts.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Hey, hey, it's okay.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I mean, do you think?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,104
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

41
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:14,500
trapped in the Witherstorm...
