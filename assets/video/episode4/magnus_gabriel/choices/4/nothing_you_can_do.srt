1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,681
Look, even if your friends are out there somewhere, there's

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,000
nothing you can do for them.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
What? No, if they're alive, I have to go after them.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
They might need me, Jesse.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
You can't just up and leave, Lukas. You're part of our team.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Lukas...

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Look, you and me, we've made a pretty good team so far.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,241
And even call us friends. So I hope you'll understand why I

10
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,000
need to go help my old friends.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,466
I can't believe I'm saying this, but if your heart's

12
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,000
telling you to go, then you gotta go.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Otherwise you'd be heartless or something.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,253
Thank you, Jesse. I'll find them. And then I'll find you

15
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,000
again, too. I promise.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thanks.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:10,670
Hey, buddy. You doing okay? Of course you are. Wish I could

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,000
say the same for everyone else.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We've lost too many people already.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thanks for watching!
