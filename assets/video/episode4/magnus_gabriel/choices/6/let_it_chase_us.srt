1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,918
The Witherstorms are already chasing us. If we just get

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:05,200
them to chase us to your fortress again...

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
They'll be caught between a rock and a hard place!

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,838
Ugh... yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it.

6
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:18,960
Not even a Formita Bomb.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,040
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
What kind of failsafe, exactly?

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,176
An enchanting book! One that contains the power of the

10
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:30,960
command block itself.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,798
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the

12
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,880
command block to bits. Forever!

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Yes. Yes, that's it!

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:56,400
Ivor? Well, I'll be. It is you.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,400
A pleasure, as always, Ellegaardd. It just keeps coming for us.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,245
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says

17
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,400
it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,779
The point is, we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as

19
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,440
long as we have that amulet.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,115
I'll take it. I'll keep the Witherstorms busy. You guys do

21
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,320
what you gotta do.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
Axel, thank you.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,328
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at

24
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,480
Soren's fortress.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,794
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm going with

26
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:28,080
him.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
I appreciate that.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,400
Well, I wanna go with Jesse. That feels like where I belong.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,800
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,527
Hey, Jesse, let's try our handshake again, just once for

31
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:46,800
the road.
