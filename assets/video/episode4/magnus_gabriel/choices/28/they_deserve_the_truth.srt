1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're right. They do deserve to know.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,000
We all owe a great debt to Jesse and his friends.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,520
But I owe a debt to you people as well.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Which is why...

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,240
there is something I want to tell you about the Order.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
The Order of the Stone is not what you all believed.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,240
We were... frauds.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,240
We used the Command Block to falsify our legacy.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,240
We were no heroes.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,240
So it is time for the world to celebrate new heroes.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,240
So it is time for the world to celebrate new heroes.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Real heroes.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Thank you. Thank you everyone.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I know you think I'm up here because I saved the world or something.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,240
But the truth is I didn't do it alone. Far from it.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
You see, I had my friends with me.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,240
It was Olivia, Axel, Petra, Lucas.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240
They stood by my side right from the start.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Well, and they made fun of me when I deserved it.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
That's just how we are.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Dang right we are.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,240
It's crazy to think my friends and I started out in a treehouse.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Now we've been to some of the weirdest places in the world.

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,240
I mean, come on, we went to the Far Lands.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,240
There was this gigantic wall and a huge maze and a model of the Ender Dragon that...

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240
well, you just had to be there.

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,240
But when all was said and done, you know what really mattered?

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
The End.
