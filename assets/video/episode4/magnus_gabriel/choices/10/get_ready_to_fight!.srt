1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Everyone, this can be a really nasty fight.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
The rest of you, go!

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,300
Hold them off!

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,800
What? Ivor, no!

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,300
There's no time to argue.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,000
Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,600
The what wall?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey you, witch! You're not the only one who can draw a potion!

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Come on!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Wow!

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
You lost them for wow?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
What is that?

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Oh...

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Wow...

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friends.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,100
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,600
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
I'd rather be hungry than boiling in some cauldron.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I'd rather be eating dinner.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,100
Quite a sight, isn't it?

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,100
Sauron, have you been here before?

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,100
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,100
How can Ivor live here?

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,100
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End, but this...

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,900
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm sure he lives here.

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
This way, I suspect.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lucas were here.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
Come on!

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Is this... a maze?

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
It would appear so.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,300
A massive one from the looks of it.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,300
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold unspeakable peril.

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Fortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
There has to be another way.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,800
A secret door, or... I don't know.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Somewhere around.
