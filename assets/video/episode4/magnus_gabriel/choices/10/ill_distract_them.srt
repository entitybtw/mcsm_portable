1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We need to distract them! Get out of here!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fine! But how?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The rest of you, go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll hold them off!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What? Ivor, no!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,257
There's no time to argue. Just head for the corner of the

7
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:13,000
glitch wall!

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The what wall?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,483
Hey you, witch! You're not the only one who can draw a

10
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:18,000
potion!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come on!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You lost them for wow?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is that?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh...

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to the Far Lands.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,103
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall

21
00:00:57,103 --> 00:00:59,000
thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'd rather be hungry than boiling in some cauldron.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd rather be eating dinner.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, wow.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm so hungry.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm so hungry.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm so hungry.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm so hungry.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm so hungry.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm so hungry.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm so hungry.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm so hungry.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Swerne, have you been here before?

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How can Ivor live here?

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,819
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the

39
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,000
End, but this...

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,523
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

42
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:51,000
research.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,454
Whatever Ivor's hiding in here, it will be extremely well

44
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,000
guarded.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This way, I suspect.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lukas were here.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ivor's hiding in here.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is this... a maze?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It would appear so.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,782
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

53
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:43,000
unspeakable peril.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There has to be another way.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A secret door, or... I don't know.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Some way around.
