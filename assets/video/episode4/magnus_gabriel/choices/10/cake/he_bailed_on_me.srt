1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Come on!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Wow!

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,120
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
What is that?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Oh... wow.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,320
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,840
Hmm... I think I like cake.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Who doesn't like cake?

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,840
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Saren, have you been here before?

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,840
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,612
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the

22
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:25,840
End, but this...

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,820
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,360
research.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,822
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

27
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:35,360
guarded.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,360
This way, I suspect.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lukas were here.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Come on!

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,160
Oh, thanks.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm glad you're here, Ivor.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Is this... a maze?

34
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,360
It would appear so.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,360
A massive one from the looks of it.

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,957
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it would hold

37
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:23,360
a speaking peril.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,860
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,360
There has to be another way.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,360
A secret door, or... I don't know...

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Some way around.
