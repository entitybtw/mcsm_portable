1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Come on!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Wow!

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,400
What is that?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Oh... wow.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,400
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Hmm... I think I like cake.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Who doesn't like cake?

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Saren, have you been here before?

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,800
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,800
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End, but this...

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,400
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
This way, I suspect.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lucas were here.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Come on!

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Is this... a maze?

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
It would appear so.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
A massive one from the looks of it.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,400
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold a speaking peril.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Because some part of you still knows Ivor lives here.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm sure he's been here before.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm sure he's been here before.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm sure he's been here before.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm sure he's been here before.

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
Some part of you still knows Ivor.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Fortunately, it seems to be the only way forward.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There has to be another way.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
A secret door, or... I don't know...

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
Some way around.
