00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,373
Guys, check it out. Use the Pistons, the Redstone, and the

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:06,560
TNT to build a TNT launcher.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,742
Then I climb on and you guys blast me all the way into the

4
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:11,680
Witherstorm.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,120
Haha, heck yeah! I love that idea.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh, look out!

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,720
Petra!

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,920
Axel!

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Aaaaaah!

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Aaaaaah!

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Whoa!

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Gah!

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
I can't hold on!

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
I got you!

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Lukas, you're here!

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Ocelots, distract that Witherstorm!

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Hey you! Get a load of this!

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Lukas, thank you.

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Anything for a friend.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Okay, it's finished.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Okay, it's finished.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Okay, it's finished.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Okay, it's finished.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Quick, climb on!

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
We all do.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Now go demolish that command block.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Reuben, this is no place for a...

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Heeeeeeeet!

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Aaaaaah!

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Aaaaaah!

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Aaaaaah!

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Go!

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Whoa!

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Gah!

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
There it is.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
We meet again, command block.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Now it's time to destroy you.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Holy moly!

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Still on time!

50
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,704
Reuben, if it ever happens, we have to destroy that command

51
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:17,920
block.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,704
Reuben, if it ever happens, we have to destroy that command

53
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:19,920
block.

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

56
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
The tractor beam!

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
The tractor beam!

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Hey you!

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Hey you!

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey you!

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Hey you!

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Hey you!

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Hey you!

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Hey you!

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Hey you!

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Hey you!

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Hey you!

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Hey you!

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Hey you!

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Hey you!

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Hey you!

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Hey you!
