1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
My hero, Reuben the Pig.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,760
He may have seemed like just a pig to most people,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,100
but he was so much more.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,060
And at the end of the day, he saved us all.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,940
For Reuben!

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,600
Jesse, this Nether Star is all that remained

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
when the Wither Storm was destroyed.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,040
Would you please do the honors?

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,940
Oh, man, this stage is so cool.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm so excited.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,940
I'm so excited.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,940
I'm so excited.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,940
I'm so excited.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,940
I'm so excited.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,940
Man, this stage is so cool.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,940
My friends, I am now pleased to introduce to you

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,940
a new Order of the Stone.

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,940
A new Order of the Stone!

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,940
And so it was that a new Order of the Stone was born,

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,940
one whose adventures were only just beginning.

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
For though the world had been saved

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,940
and the command block destroyed,

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,940
there are many more worlds than just this one.

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Thank you for watching.
