1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That was absolutely amazing!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,000
They didn't call us the Order of the Stone for nothing.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,300
I wonder if that story will help me solve this puzzle.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,000
Bow and arrow, great weapons.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a sword. So Soren rode the dragon, huh?

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Hey Reuben, give me a boost, will ya?

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Aha!

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, that's it!

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then Gabriel poked it dead with a sword.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Bravo! You did it!

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's the book.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Wait, aren't those the Ender crystals?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Like, the real ones?

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
No, it can't be.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,638
But those things were destroyed in your big heroic battle

17
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,000
with the Ender dragon, right, Soren?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He kept them. The fool actually kept them.

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Soren, you said destroying these crystals was the key to

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
defeating the Ender dragon.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You did kill the Ender dragon, right?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,532
Jesse, this isn't... this isn't what it looks like. Our

23
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:54,000
story, the story, it's mostly true. I swear, I swear.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Soren, I want the truth and I want it now.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can't. We swore never to speak of it.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't care.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,131
I'm afraid I haven't been honest with you, Jesse. We did

28
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:11,483
defeat the Ender dragon, but it... it wasn't exactly like I

29
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:12,000
said.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How not exactly?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We got rid of it, but we didn't kill it, per se.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So what did you do to it?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We didn't do anything. We used the command block.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You used the command block to defeat the Ender dragon?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm afraid so.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,032
Understand, when I found that blasted block, we were

37
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,000
nobodies.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,638
But with its help, we became stronger, faster, we could do

39
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,000
so much more.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,928
The others had no idea what I was doing. Yet the more I

41
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:59,000
used it, the more we came to depend on it.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I knew it was only so long before someone would find out.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, I concocted a plan.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,041
I would use the command block to blink the Ender dragon out

45
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,000
of existence.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Securing our status as legends forever.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We told the world we defeated a dragon.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And the rest is history.
