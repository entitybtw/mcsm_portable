1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Soren, you coward, I can't believe you!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,920
I can.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,040
Jesse, you can handle things out here, right?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
What?!

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,920
I can't let him get himself killed!

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,680
Just get to the command block and destroy it!

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,720
Soren!

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,680
So much for the mighty Order of the Stone.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
Doesn't matter. We have work to do.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
We need to get those Endermen to attack it!

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Jesse, that's it!

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Make them chase you into the tractor beam!

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
The tractor beam!

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
Jesse, that's it!

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,400
Make them chase you into the tractor beam!

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
How do you like that?

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm a black freak.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes!

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes, they're falling for it!

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
One more!

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Jesse, look! It's working!

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Now we just need to find you a way up.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,000
Or build you a way up.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's it!

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone, empty your pockets!

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Let's see...

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Ivor's armory.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
I have some TNT from Boomtown.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
I've got pistons, repeaters...

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Lukas gave me some wool.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
And I took some slime from the maze.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
The minecart?

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Or those pistons...

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
And we do have all that cobblestone.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Maybe we could build a ramp?

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Or even go straight up vertically?

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Or find a way to use redstone?

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
We're close to an answer. I can feel it!
