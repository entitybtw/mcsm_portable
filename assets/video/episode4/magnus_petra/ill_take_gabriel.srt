1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
I'll take Gabriel.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,560
Then I've got Petra.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,280
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,880
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,640
Ah!

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,040
I looked.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,920
Watch out!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
It's gaining on us!

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
We're not gonna make it!

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
Just keep it together, Gabriel.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
Don't let it come any closer!

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm trying!

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Jesse, look out!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm gonna get you!

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Am I seeing Andermen attack a wither storm?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Andermen move blocks, it's what they do.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
There, we need to head over there.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
The bridge.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Guys, come on!

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
We gotta build a new one, like right now.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,200
Come on, faster!

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
Yee-haw!

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Woo!

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Axel, you're screaming in my ear!

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Sorry.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
We made it!

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
We actually freaking made it!

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Hey, how are you feeling?

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
I...

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm afraid I don't feel much like myself at the moment.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Gabriel!

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
It really is you!

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
It really is you!

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh, I knew if anybody could outrun death it would be you!

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Who are you people?

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,400
It's me, Ellegaardd, come on!

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Old friend, don't you recognize us?

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
It's Sorin.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
We've known each other for a very long time.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm sorry.
