00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,908
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to

3
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:30,520
go and place these pistons.

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,020
Holy cow, we did it!

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,520
Thanks, Jesse.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,520
And thanks for everything you said just before.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
It really helped.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
No problemo.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
It must be this way!

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Run!

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Everybody get on!

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Quick, onto the barge!

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
That was close. Everyone okay?

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
For the moment.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,872
I remember something. Didn't Ellegaardd build a machine like

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,520
this once?

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Yes, in the nether.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,520
And you were terrified of flying on it!

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,520
What? Stuff and nonsense.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,520
No, no, I'm positive.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,520
You spent the whole ride quivering in terror.
