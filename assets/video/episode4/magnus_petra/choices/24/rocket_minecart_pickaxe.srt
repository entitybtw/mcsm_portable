00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,965
Guys, check it out. We build a cobblestone ramp, lay down

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:04,800
some track,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,375
attach the TNT to the minecart, and launch it off the ramp

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,300
like a rocket!

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
Heck yeah! I love that idea!

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,800
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,300
Oh, look out!

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Petra!

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Axel!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't... hold on!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I got you!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Lukas! You're here!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Lukas, thank you.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Anything for a friend.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, it's finished.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Quick, climb on!

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We all do.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thanks, guys. It means a lot.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now go to walls that command block.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, let's go.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, let's go.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay, let's go.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, let's go.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Reuben, this is no place for a...

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Big...

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Aaaaaah!

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Aaaaaah!

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wow.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No!

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There it is.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We meet again, command block.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We're gonna have to be careful.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm gonna go get the others.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, let's go.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Alright.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Holy moly!

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
At least they won't die!

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ah!

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,555
Reuben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

51
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,000
block.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The tractor beam!

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, you!

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.
