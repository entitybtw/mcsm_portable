00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,587
Guys, check it out. We build a cobblestone ramp, lay down

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:07,174
some track, attach the TNT to the minecart, and launch it

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,000
off the ramp like a rocket!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Heck yeah! I love that idea!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, look out!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Axle!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can't hold on!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I got you!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Lukas! You're here!

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Lukas, thank you!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Anything for a friend.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, it's finished!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Quick, climb on!

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And Jesse, I know you can do this.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We all do.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thanks guys.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a lot.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now go demolish that command block.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Reuben, there's no place for ruben.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wow.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No!

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There it is.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We meet again, command block.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll finish you off.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Holy moly!

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Still time!

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,555
Reuben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

36
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:19,000
block.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The tractor beam!

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey you!

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey you!
