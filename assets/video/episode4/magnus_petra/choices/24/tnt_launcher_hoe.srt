00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,373
Guys, check it out. Use the Pistons, the Redstone, and the

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:06,560
TNT to build a TNT launcher.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,611
Then I climb on and you guys blast me all the way into the

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,520
Witherstorm.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
Heck yeah! I love that idea.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,680
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,120
Oh, look out!

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,080
Axle!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
No!

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
I can't hold on!

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
I got you!

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
Lukas! You're here!

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Ocelots, distract that Witherstorm!

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
Hey you! Get a load of this!

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
Lukas, thank you. Anything for a friend.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
Okay. Now let's hurry up and build this thing.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay, it's finished.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,040
Quick, climb on!

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,160
And Jesse, I know you can do this.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,360
We all do.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,440
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Now go demolish that command block.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Reuben, this is no place for a...

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Jesse!

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,320
Wow.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,320
There it is.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,320
We meet again, command block.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,320
Now it's time to destroy you.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Ah!

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,320
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Awesome weapon. Don't fail me now.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,162
Reuben, what ever happens, we have to destroy that command

34
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:01,600
block.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Shh!

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Okay, let's go.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Okay.

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Okay.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Okay.

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Okay.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Okay.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Okay.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Okay.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay.

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Okay.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
The tractor beams!

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Hey, you!

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,260
you
