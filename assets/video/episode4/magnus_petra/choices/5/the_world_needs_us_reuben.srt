1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The world needs us, Reuben.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,285
So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock, and it's

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,720
up to us to save the rest of it.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,255
Well, maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and

5
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:13,040
a pig, but we have to find a way.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, you wanted help, do you?

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,003
That's what I said, isn't it? Oh, just as you once helped

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:20,560
us before.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,974
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

10
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:27,040
three of those things now. You say that like it's my fault!

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,470
It is your fault! I'll take responsibility for once, Soren.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,520
Soren, you need to listen to me. Hush, Ivor, for once!

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,773
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

14
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:39,760
reason. What you don't understand is you are all in very

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,560
grave danger.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,129
Obviously! No, I mean specifically this group. The

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,720
Witherstorm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
What?

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,922
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following

22
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:05,360
Jesse!

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I... I didn't know.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
And it's only getting stronger!

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,842
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those

26
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,360
things! Nothing even hurts them!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,595
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of

28
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:22,000
Endermen pull blocks off a Witherstorm.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,714
So, enough of them working together might be able to

30
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,000
destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,047
Question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen

32
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:34,000
together?

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Thanks for watching!
