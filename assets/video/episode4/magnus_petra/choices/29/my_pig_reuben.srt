1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
My hero, Reuben the Pig.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,760
He may have seemed like just a pig to most people,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,100
but he was so much more.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,060
And at the end of the day, he saved us all.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,940
For Reuben!

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,600
Jesse, this Nether Star is all that remained

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,740
when the Wither Storm was destroyed.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,980
Would you please do the honors?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,180
Oh, man, this stage is so cool.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,180
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,180
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,180
Oh, my God.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,180
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,180
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,180
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,180
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,180
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,180
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,180
Oh, my God.

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,080
Control it.

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,720
By friends, I am now pleased to introduce to you...

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,180
A new Order of the Stone!

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,180
And so it was that a new Order of the Stone was born.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,180
One whose adventures were only just beginning.

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,532
For though the world had been saved and the command block

28
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,180
destroyed,

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,180
there are many more worlds than just this one.

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,180
Thanks for watching!
