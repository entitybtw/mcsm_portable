1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,681
Look, even if your friends are out there somewhere, there's

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,000
nothing you can do for them.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
What? No, if they're alive, I have to go after them.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
They might need me, Jesse.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
You can't just up and leave, Lukas. You're part of our team.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Lukas...

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Look, you and me, we've made a pretty good team so far.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I'd even call us friends.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,084
So I hope you'll understand why I need to go help my old

11
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:28,500
friends.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,677
I can't believe I'm saying this, but if your heart's

13
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,000
telling you to go, then you gotta go.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Otherwise you'd be heartless or something.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,794
Thank you, Jesse. I'll find them. And then I'll find you

16
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,500
again, too.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I promise.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thanks.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey, buddy. You doing okay?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Of course you are.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Wish I could say the same for everyone else.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We've lost too many people already.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Thanks for watching!
