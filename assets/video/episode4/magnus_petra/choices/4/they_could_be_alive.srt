00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Lukas, your friends could still be out there!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
I know! And that means I... I gotta go after them!

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
They might need me, Jesse.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,700
You can't just up and leave, Lukas. You're part of our team.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,200
And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,200
Lukas...

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,800
Look, you and me, we've made a pretty good team so far.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,500
I even call us friends.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,384
So I hope you'll understand why I need to go help my old

10
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:23,800
friends.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,700
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,800
If your heart's telling you to go...

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Then you gotta go.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
Otherwise, you'd be... heartless, or something.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,900
Thank you, Jesse.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll find them. And then I'll find you again, too.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,600
I promise.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Thanks.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Hey, buddy. You doing okay?

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Of course you are.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,900
Wish I could say the same for everyone else.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
We've lost too many people already.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thanks for watching!
