1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,938
This isn't your fault. It's Ivor's who wouldn't do

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:04,760
something stupid for a diamond

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,861
But without my help Ivor wouldn't have wouldn't have wanted

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,040
revenge on Gabriel

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,237
Believe me. He would have found another way. I'm gonna do

6
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:16,560
everything I can to make this right

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,852
Petra I know this isn't easy to hear but you're too sick to

8
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,720
be going anywhere. I'm not that sick

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,428
Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while. I mean it's

10
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:31,780
safe

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
Defensible I say I'm fine then I'm

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160
Fine

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
You staying here is the right move

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,731
You'll never get better if we keep pushing you but I want

15
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,680
to be there for you guys. I know you do and you will

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,593
Maybe you're right. It's the right call Jesse. I hope so.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,000
We didn't all make it back though

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Guys it was my fault

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,173
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor, but you couldn't have

20
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:06,040
known what was going to happen

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,936
She's right. You can't blame yourself. Jesse. I'm surprised

22
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,880
he lasted as long as he did

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Being emotional is getting us nowhere

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,481
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why

25
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,960
is that thing still alive?

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,265
The formidable just wasn't strong enough. I mean it ripped

27
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,800
the wither storm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,480
command block

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
So the command block is still out there. Oh

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Great

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,120
Question is what do we do?

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,470
Why are you asking me am I expected to know every last

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,880
thing in the universe?

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Huh? I need a moment to think

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,760
Is he always like this you have no idea?

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
That jacket I recognize it

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Lukas always wears that jacket. No, there were other people

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,942
wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the

40
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:12,480
monster

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
It hurts just to think about just put it out of your mind

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Jesse if what Gabriel said is true, I

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,318
Mean do you think I thought for sure they were gone, but if

44
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,320
they were just trapped in the wither storm

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
You
