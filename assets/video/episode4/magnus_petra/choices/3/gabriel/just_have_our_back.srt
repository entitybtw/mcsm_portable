1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,414
You can thank me by watching out for me and my friends.

2
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:03,600
This fight isn't over yet.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,600
Very well.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,548
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive, which is more

6
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:25,000
than I can say for some of us.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, Magnus. For a second there, I almost managed to forget.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You guys talking about Magnus?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I still can't believe he's gone.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Magnus's armor.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah! Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,714
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why

16
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,000
is that thing still alive?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,681
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

19
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,000
a dent in the command block.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The question is, what do we do?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,525
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last

24
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,000
thing in the universe?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I need a moment to think.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is he always like this?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You have no idea.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That jacket! I recognize it!

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Lukas always wears that jacket.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,064
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket

31
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,000
when I was thrown from the monster.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It hurts just to think about it.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just put it out of your mind.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I mean, do you think?

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,604
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

37
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:11,000
trapped in the witherstorm...
