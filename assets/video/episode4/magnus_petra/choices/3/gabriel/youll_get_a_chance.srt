1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You'll get your chance Gabriel, this fight isn't over yet.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Very well.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,200
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,048
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive. Which is more

5
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:23,500
than I can say for some of us.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Magnus, for a second there, I almost managed to forget.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
You guys talking about Magnus?

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I still can't believe he's gone.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Guys, it was my fault.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm the one who took Magnus' armor.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,000
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,411
What I want to know is, what happened out there today? Why

16
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,000
is that thing still alive?

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,346
I mean, it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

19
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,500
a dent in the command block.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
So the command block is still out there?

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, great.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The question is, what do we do?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,878
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last

25
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:25,500
thing in the universe?

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I need a moment to think.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Is he always like this?

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
You have no idea.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
That jacket! I recognize it!

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Lucas always wears that jacket.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,870
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,000
when I was thrown from the monster!

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It hurts just to think about.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just put it out of your mind.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I mean, do you think?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,255
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

38
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,000
trapped in the Witherstorm...

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sure they're still there.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sure they're still there.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sure they're still there.
