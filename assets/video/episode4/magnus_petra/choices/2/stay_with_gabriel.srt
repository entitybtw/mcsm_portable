1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Not gonna lie, but we've dealt with worse, right?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Have we?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,700
How's it going?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Tell me, Jesse, who is this person?

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,500
She keeps insulting me.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,700
That right there is Ellegaardd. Ellie to you.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,700
Ellegaardd, hmm?

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
And how do I know her exactly?

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,205
You guys defeated the Ender Dragon together, the most

10
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,400
fearsome creature this land has ever seen.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Really?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Yeah, really! You're kind of a big deal.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
It isn't working. He doesn't remember anything.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,623
Talk to him about your past, something only you would know

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,000
about.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hmm... like what?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Talk about fighting the Ender Dragon.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't think so. I've told that story way too many times.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Which is why it might help.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Ah, okay, fine.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Ender Dragon. Scariest thing alive, right?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Well, for most of the battle, it looked like we were goners.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
But you know who finally slayed that beast?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Um, was it Jesse?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What? No! It was you, Gabriel. You slayed it!

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh... thank you for sharing that with me.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
And Jesse, thank you too. You've been a big help here.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I, uh... I need to repay your kindness.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm not sure how exactly.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
But I want to express my gratitude.
