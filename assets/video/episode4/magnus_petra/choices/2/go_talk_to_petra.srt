00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You feeling any better?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,793
Better is relative. If I just sit here and don't move or

3
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:12,000
breathe, it's almost bearable.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Man, if it wasn't for Ivor, she wouldn't even be like this.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,192
No kidding. That's not exactly true. Ivor built the wither,

6
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:26,032
sure, but he couldn't have done it without that skull I

7
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:27,000
gave him.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,750
If I'd just taken a second to think about it, all I cared

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,000
about was getting that stupid diamond.
