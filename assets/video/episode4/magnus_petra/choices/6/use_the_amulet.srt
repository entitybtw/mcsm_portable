1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,596
We know for a fact the wither storm will follow the

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:05,498
ambulance. So if we take the amulet back to your fortress

3
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:06,720
where the endermen are

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,532
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap. Just one

5
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:13,680
problem. You're forgetting about the command block

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,240
Yes

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,480
It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,996
Not even a formidable. Yes. Well, I created a fail safe.

9
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,120
What kind of fail safe exactly?

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
an enchanting book

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
One that contains the power of the command block itself

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,764
Use it to enchant a weapon and you'll be able to smash the

13
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,040
command block to bits

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
forever

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Yes, that's it

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Ivor?

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Ivor? Well, I'll be

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,120
It is you

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
The pleasure as always, Ellegaardd

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,320
It just keeps coming for us

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,615
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says

23
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,302
it's because of the amulet that Gabriel the point is we

24
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,280
need to get moving

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,140
We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet. I'll

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,680
take it

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,329
I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do what you got

28
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,880
to do. Axel. Thank you. You just go make that super weapon

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,074
I'll meet you back at soren's fortress. Well, axel

30
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,760
shouldn't have to do this alone

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm going with him. I appreciate that

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,308
Well, i'm going with jesse. I pledge to help and that's

33
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,320
what I must do

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Everyone take good care of yourselves

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,822
Hey jesse, let's try our handshake again just once for the

36
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:47,300
road
