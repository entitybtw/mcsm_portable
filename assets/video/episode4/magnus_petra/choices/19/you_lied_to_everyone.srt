1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,274
Why would you do that? You lied, even to your closest

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:05,000
friends!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All I can say is...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I was a fool.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So you finally admit it.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Soren, how could you?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ivor, how long have you guys been standing there?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Long enough that they heard the whole thing.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we're liars, all of us.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,575
You didn't think you could keep it secret forever, did you,

11
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,000
Soren?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is this why you left the Order? Because Soren lied?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because they all did.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,283
Soren, Gabriel, Magnus, Ellegaardd, they agreed to keep this a

15
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,000
secret.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,578
And you? You agreed to stay quiet too, in exchange for all

17
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:49,000
of our treasures.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've technically never told anybody.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,089
So this whole thing, the wither you unleashed, it's all

20
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:59,000
been to teach the Order a lesson?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,090
To teach the world a lesson! To show you who the Order

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,000
really are.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Liars, cowards! And now, they know.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, I suppose they do.
