1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Soren, I looked up to you. The whole world did.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nobody is more ashamed than me.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So you finally admit it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Soren, how could you?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ivor, how long have you guys been standing there?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Long enough that they heard the whole thing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're liars. All of us.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,575
You didn't think you could keep it secret forever, did you,

9
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,000
Soren?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is this why you left the Order? Because Soren lied?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because they all did.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,402
Soren, Gabriel, Magnus, Ellegaardd. They agreed to keep this a

13
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:41,000
secret.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,578
And you? You agreed to stay quiet too, in exchange for all

15
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,000
of our treasures.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've technically never told anybody.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,089
So this whole thing, the wither you unleashed, it's all

18
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,000
been to teach the Order a lesson?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,090
To teach the world a lesson. To show you who the Order

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,000
really are.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Liars, cowards. And now, they know.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes. I suppose they do.
