1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Reuben, stay out of sight.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Anything goes wrong, I don't want you caught up in it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bet you can't catch me!

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why did I have to look down?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to get you!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going to get you!

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Reuben, I need your help!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Reuben, I need your help!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Remember how we used to play fetch?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Remember how we used to play fetch?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's it, that's it!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come on, Reuben, I believe in you!

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ah!

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Jump, I'll catch you!

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You did it! I knew I could count on you!

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll put an end to this thing once and for all.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Reuben! Hold on, buddy!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Reuben!

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No!

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ah!

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah!

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Run!

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ah!

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There you are!

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Jesse, are you all right? We thought you were...

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean, I didn't think you'd made it.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
