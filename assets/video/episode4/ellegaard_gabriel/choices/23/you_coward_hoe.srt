1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Soren, you coward, I can't believe you!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,920
I can.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,040
Jesse, you can handle things out here, right?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
What?!

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,920
I can't let him get himself killed!

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,680
Just get to the command block and destroy it!

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,720
Soren!

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,680
So much for the mighty Order of the Stone.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
Doesn't matter. We have work to do.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
We need to get those Endermen to attack it!

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,200
The Tractor Beam!

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Jesse, that's it!

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Make them chase you into the Tractor Beam!

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
How do you like that, Purple Eye?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Freaking awesome!

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
How do you like that, Purple Eye?

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Freaking awesome!

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Yes, they're falling for it!

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Jesse, look! It's working!

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Now we just need to find you a way up.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Or build you a way up.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
That's it!

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Everyone, empty your pockets!

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Let's see...

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Ivor's Armory.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I've got pistons, repeaters...

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Lucas gave me some more.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
And I took some slime from the maze.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Oh, and I still have some.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm going to have to get some more.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
I need some more.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
And I took some slime from the maze.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
That's got to be enough to make something, right?

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,200
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
The minecart?

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Or those pistons.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
And we do have all that cobblestone.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Maybe we could build a ramp?

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Or even go straight up vertically.

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Or find a way to use redstone.

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
We're close to an answer. I can feel it.
