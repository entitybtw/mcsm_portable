1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,920
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,720
let him get himself killed

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Just get to the command block and destroy it. Sorry

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,100
So much for the mighty order of the stone

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Doesn't matter. We have work to do

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Tractor beam Jesse that's it

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,240
Make them chase you into the tractor beam

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
I

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Yes, they're falling for it.

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Jesse, look!

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
It's working!

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
The hole's big enough to get inside of.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Now we just need to find you a way up.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Or build you a way up.

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
That's it!

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Everyone, empty your pockets!

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Let's see...

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Ivor's Armory.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,160
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
I've got pistons, repeaters...

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,963
Lukas gave me some wool, and I took some slime from the

24
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,160
maze.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
The minecart?

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Or those pistons...

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
And we do have all that cobblestone.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Maybe we could build a ramp?

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Or even go straight up vertically.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Or find a way to use redstone.

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
We're close to an answer. I can feel it!
