1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,920
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,720
let him get himself killed

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Just get to the command block and destroy it. Sorry

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,100
So much for the mighty order of the stone

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Doesn't matter. We have work to do

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Tractor beam Jesse that's it

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,240
Make them chase you into the tractor beam

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Yes, they're falling for it.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Jesse look, it's working.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Now we just need to find you a way up.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Or build you a way up.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
That's it.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Everyone, empty your pockets.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Let's see.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Ivor's Armory.

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
I've got pistons, repeaters.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Lukas gave me some wool.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
And I took some slime from the maze.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
The minecart?

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Or the minecart.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
And we do have all that cobblestone.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Maybe we could build a ramp?

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Or even go straight up vertically.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Or find a way to use redstone.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
We're close to an answer.

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
I can feel it.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
I'm sorry.
