1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're right. They do deserve to know.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,000
We all owe a great debt to Jesse and his friends.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,520
But I owe a debt to you people as well.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,380
Which is why there is something I want to tell you about

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,280
the Order.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,280
The Order of the Stone is not what you all believed.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,280
We were frauds.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,280
We used the Command Block to falsify our legacy.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,280
We were no heroes.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,280
So it is time for the world to celebrate new heroes.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Real heroes.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Thank you. Thank you everyone.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,632
I know you think I'm up here because I saved the world or

14
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:16,280
something.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
But the truth is I didn't do it alone. Far from it.

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
You see, I had my friends with me.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
It was Olivia, Axel, Petra, Lukas.

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,280
They stood by my side right from the start.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Well, and they made fun of me when I deserved it.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
But that's just how we are.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Dang right we are.

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,849
It's crazy to think my friends and I started out in a tree

23
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,280
house.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Now we've been to some of the weirdest places in the world.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I mean, come on, we went to the Far Lands.

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,791
There was this gigantic wall and a huge maze and a model of

27
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,280
the Ender Dragon that...

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Well, you just had to be there.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,634
But when all was said and done, you know what really

30
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:07,280
mattered?

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
You
