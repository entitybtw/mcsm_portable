1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,118
Look, there were two of you caught in the tractor beam that

2
00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:03,700
day and...

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,700
Well, I helped Gabriel.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
The sick guy over there.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh...

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Yeah, I think I do remember that.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,736
You gotta realize I thought we needed him if it was just

8
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:17,800
about who I liked.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
No, I get it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
You did what you had to do.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
All that matters is you're with us now.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,000
And that you're still a fighter.

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
The best one I know.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,300
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Alright. Count me in.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
We didn't all make it back, though.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Guys, it was my fault.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm the one who took Ellegaardd's armor.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,800
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,800
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I, uh, never blame myself for anything.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
What I want to know is what happened out there today.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
Why is that thing still alive?

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,146
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

27
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:14,300
a dent in the command block.

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
So the command block is still out there?

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, great.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
The question is, what do we do?

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Why are you asking me?

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I need a moment to think.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
Is he always like this?

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
You have no idea.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
That jacket, it looks familiar.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Lukas always wears that jacket.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,566
I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown from

40
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,800
that dead monster.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Even thinking about it hurts.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Hey, hey, it's okay.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I mean, do you think?

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,230
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,800
trapped in the witherstorm...
