1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,481
I couldn't save you. Things were happening so fast and that

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:06,000
thing was powerful.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, thank you for trying.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Um, sure.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All that matters is you're with us now.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And that you're still a fighter. The best one I know.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright, count me in.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We didn't all make it back though.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Guys, it was my fault.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm the one who took Ellegaardd's armor.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I, uh, never blame myself for anything.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ah! Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,392
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why

17
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,000
is that thing still alive?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,681
I mean, it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

20
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,000
a dent in the command block.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The question is, what do we do?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why are you asking me?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I need a moment to think.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is he always like this?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You have no idea.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That jacket, it looks familiar.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lukas always wears that jacket.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,925
Oh, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

32
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,000
from that dead monster.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Even thinking about it hurts.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, hey, it's okay.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean, do you think?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,255
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

38
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,000
trapped in the Witherstorm...
