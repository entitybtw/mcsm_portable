1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
Doesn't matter how this started or who started it. We just

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:04,000
have to end it.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,860
You're right. I know you're right. I only wish I could

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,120
continue to help.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,680
It was dark and foul and I was sure I was a goner.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,675
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive, which is more

7
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,040
than I can say for some of us.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh man, Ellie. For a second I almost managed to forget.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,840
Are you guys talking about Ellegard?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,680
I just can't believe she's gone. It doesn't feel real.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,907
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Ellegard's

12
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:47,440
armor.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,880
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,633
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid. I never blame

15
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,200
myself for anything.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
Ah! Being emotional is getting us nowhere.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,280
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,720
is that thing still alive?

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,840
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,039
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

21
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,120
a dent in the command block.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
The question is, what do we do?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,158
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last

26
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,480
thing in the universe?

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
I need a moment to think.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
Is he always like this?

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
You have no idea.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
That jacket, it looks familiar.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Lukas always wears that jacket.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,325
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

33
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,080
from that dead monster.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,520
Even thinking about it hurts.

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey, hey, it's okay.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Jesse, if what Petra said is true... I mean, do you think?

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,044
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

38
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,440
trapped in the witherstorm...
