1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
We've all made mistakes, including Ivor, right?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, nothing's quite that simple.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,100
But I appreciate you saying that.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,500
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Well, you aren't.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,700
You made it back alive.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,900
Which is more than I can say for some of us.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,200
Oh, man. Ellie. For a second, I almost managed to forget.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Are you guys talking about Ellegaardd?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,500
I just can't believe she's gone. Doesn't feel real.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,000
Guys, it was my fault.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm the one who took Ellegaardd's armor.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,600
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,700
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,900
I, uh, never blame myself for anything.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
What I want to know is, what happened out there today?

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
Why is that thing still alive?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,679
I mean, it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make

21
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:13,800
a dent in the command block.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,600
So the command block is still out there?

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,400
Oh, great.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,600
The question is, what do we do?

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,900
Why are you asking me?

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,100
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
I need a moment to think.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Is he always like this?

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
You have no idea.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
That jacket. It looks... familiar.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,400
Lukas always wears that jacket.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,607
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown

34
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,600
from that... that monster.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
Even thinking about it hurts.

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Hey, hey, it's okay.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I mean, do you think?

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,000
trapped in the Witherstorm...
