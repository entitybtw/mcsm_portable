1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Soren, you are so full of it.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,760
Why would you say that?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
You made it sound like you were the only one who mattered.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,360
I was the leader. Believe you me.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,240
Whatever.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,280
I wonder if that story will help me solve this puzzle.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Bow and arrow, great weapons.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's a sword.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
So Soren rode the dragon, huh?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Hey, Ruben, give me a boost, will you?

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Aha!

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, yes, that's it!

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
And then Gabriel poked it dead with a sword.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Bravo! You did it!

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
There's the book.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Wait, aren't those the Ender crystals?

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
Like the real ones?

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
No, it can't be.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,240
But those things were destroyed in your big heroic battle with the Ender Dragon, right, Soren?

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,240
He kept them. The fool actually kept them.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Soren, you said destroying these crystals was the key to defeating the Ender Dragon.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
You did kill the Ender Dragon, right?

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Jesse, this isn't what it looks like.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Our story, the story, it's mostly true. I swear it.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Soren, I want the truth and I want it now.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
I can't. We swore never to speak of it.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
I don't care.

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm afraid I haven't been honest with you, Jesse.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,480
We did defeat the Ender Dragon, but it wasn't exactly like I said.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
How not exactly?

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,480
We got rid of it, but we didn't kill it per se.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
So what did you do to it?

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,720
We didn't do anything. We used the command block.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
You used the command block to defeat the Ender Dragon?

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm afraid so.

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Understand, when I found that blasted block, we were nobodies.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,720
But with its help, we became stronger, faster. We could do so much more.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
The others had no idea what I was doing.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Yet the more I used it, the more we came to depend on it.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I knew it was only so long before someone would find out.

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Ha!

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
So, I concocted a plan.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I would use the command block to blink the Ender Dragon out of existence.

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Woo!

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Securing our status as legends forever.

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
We told the world we defeated a dragon.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,960
And the rest is history.
