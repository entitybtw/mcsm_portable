1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Everyone, this can be a really nasty fight.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
The rest of you, go!

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,300
Hold them off!

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,800
What? Ivor, no!

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,400
There's no time to argue.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,100
Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,600
The what wall?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,600
Hey, you, witch!

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,800
You're not the only one who can draw a potion!

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Come on!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You lost them for wow?

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
What is that?

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh...

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wow...

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friends.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're talking about.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,603
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall

23
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,500
thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I'd rather be hungry than boiling in some cauldron.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,500
I'd rather be eating dinner.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sauron, have you been here before?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
How can Ivor live here?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,819
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the

32
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,000
End, but this...

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,023
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

35
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:50,500
research.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,462
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

37
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,000
guarded.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
This way, I suspect.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lukas were here.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Come on!

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is this... a maze?

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
It would appear so.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,782
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

46
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,000
unspeakable peril.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,000
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Fortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
There has to be another way.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A secret door, or... I don't know.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Some way around.
