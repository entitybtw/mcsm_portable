1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Come on!

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,440
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Wow!

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
What is that?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Oh... wow.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,640
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,400
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,120
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,640
Hmm... I think I like cake.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Who doesn't like cake?

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,680
Saren, have you been here before?

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,680
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,754
I mean, it's one thing to build a war world inside the End,

22
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:25,600
but this...

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,940
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,480
research.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,942
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

27
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:35,480
guarded.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
This way, I suspect.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,520
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lucas were here.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Come on!

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is this... a maze?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It would appear so.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,782
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it would hold

35
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,000
a speakable peril.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor lives here.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sure he's been here before.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Fortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There has to be another way.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A secret door, or... I don't know.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Some way around.
