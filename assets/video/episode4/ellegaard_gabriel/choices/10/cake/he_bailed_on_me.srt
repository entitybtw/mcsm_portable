1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man!

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Come on!

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,440
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Wow!

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
What is that?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Oh... wow...

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,520
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,880
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,560
Hmm... I think I like cake.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,360
Who doesn't like cake?

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,560
Saren, have you been here before?

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,360
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,600
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,520
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,674
I mean, it's one thing to build a war world inside the End,

22
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:25,520
but this...

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,640
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,732
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

25
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:31,240
research.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,902
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

27
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:35,440
guarded.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,720
This way, I suspect.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,320
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lukas were here.

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Come on!

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Is this... a maze?

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,880
It would appear so.

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,880
A massive one from the looks of it.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,062
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

35
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,280
unspeakable peril.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,080
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Because some part of you still knows Ivor is here.

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm sure he's here.

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm sure he's here.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
I'm sure he's here.

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm sure he's here.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm sure he's here.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm sure he's here.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm sure he's here.

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm sure he's here.

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm sure he's here.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
I still know Ivor.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Fortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
There has to be another way.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
A secret door, or... I don't know.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Some way around.
