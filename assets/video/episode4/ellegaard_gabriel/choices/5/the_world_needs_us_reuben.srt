1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The world needs us, Reuben.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,285
So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock, and it's

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,720
up to us to save the rest of it.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,255
Well, maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and

5
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:13,040
a pig, but we have to find a way.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, you wanted help, do you?

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,003
That's what I said, isn't it? Oh, just as you once helped

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:20,560
us before.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,974
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

10
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:27,040
three of those things now. You say that like it's my fault!

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,920
It is your fault!

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,631
I'll take responsibility for once, Sorin. Sorin, you need

13
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,440
to listen to me.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Hush, Ivor, for once!

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,773
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

16
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:39,760
reason. What you don't understand is you are all in very

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,560
grave danger.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Obviously!

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,720
No, I mean specifically this group. The Weather Storm isn't

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,640
acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
What?

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,421
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following

25
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:00,640
Jesse!

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I didn't know.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
And it's only getting stronger.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
You don't think I realize that?

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Nothing can stop those things!

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Nothing even hurts them!

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Well, except Enderman.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,513
We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off of

33
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:14,640
us.

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,416
So enough of them working together might be able to destroy

35
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,640
a Weather Storm entirely.

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,322
Question is, how to bring the Storms and the Endermen

37
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:20,640
together?

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
At least, not from mere mortals.

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
You have the answer to that.

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
You have the answer to that.

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
You have the answer to that.

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
You have the answer to that.

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
You have the answer to that.

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
You have the answer to that.

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
You have the answer to that.

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
You have the answer to that.

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
You have the answer to that.

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
You have the answer to that.

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
You have the answer to that.
