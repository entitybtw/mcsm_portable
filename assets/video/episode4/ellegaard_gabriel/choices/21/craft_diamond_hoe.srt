00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Awesome! I've never owned a diamond weapon!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just wait till you enchant it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Behold my enchanted diamond hoe!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, that should do the job nicely.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,192
But if you're fighting those wither monsters head on,

6
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,000
you'll want better armor too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,420
I enchanted these for the Order. They're about as strong as

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,000
it comes.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even able to withstand TNT!

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any preference?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I kinda want to keep the armor I'm already wearing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I mean, Ellegaard died so I could have it, you know?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come to think of it, she would have liked that. Very well.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nice weapon, Jesse!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks!

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But at least take some for your friends.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sounds good to me.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,908
Let's get back to Soren's fortress and see how the wither

20
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:21,000
storms are doing against those Endermen.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, my poor fortress!

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see Endermen, so this means the plan's working, right?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Shouldn't the Endermen have dismantled those things already?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Or am I just confused?

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not just you. Something's wrong.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Jesse, over here!

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Axle!

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You guys made it!

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nice freakin' armor, by the way.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you still have the amulet?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Safe and sound. That's not the problem.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then what is?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The Endermen. They're not angry enough.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,132
I mean, some of them are, but a lot of them are just

36
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,000
standing around moving blocks.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, being Endermen.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ah! Blast!

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's nothing we can't handle, right?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not so sure about that.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now is not the time for cold feet, Soren!

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So what's the plan?

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, I know we gotta go in there, but...

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do we just go for it, or what?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You
