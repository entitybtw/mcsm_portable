00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,265
Guys, check it out. We use the pistons and some redstone to

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,000
build a flying machine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,831
Then when I'm high enough, I ignite the TNT and blast

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:12,000
myself into the wither storm.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Haha, heck yeah! I love that idea.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, look out!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Petra!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Axel!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Gah!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't hold on!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I got you!

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Lukas! You're here!

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Lukas, thank you. Anything for a friend.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, it's finished.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Quick, climb on!

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We all do.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now go to the walls that command block.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Reuben, this is no place for a...

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wow...

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Gah!

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There it is.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We meet again, command block.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Holy moly!

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This thing will die!

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Gah!

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,555
Reuben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

41
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,000
block.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The tractor beam!

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey, you!

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to get you, Reuben.
