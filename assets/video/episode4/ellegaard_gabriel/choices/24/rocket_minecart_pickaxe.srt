00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,587
Guys, check it out. We build a cobblestone ramp, lay down

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:07,174
some track, attach the TNT to the minecart, and launch it

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,000
off the ramp like a rocket!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Heck yeah! I love that idea!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, look out!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Petra!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Axel!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't... hold on!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I got you!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Lucas! You're here!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Lucas, thank you.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Anything for a friend.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, it's finished.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Quick, climb on!

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We all do.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now go to walls that command block.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, let's go.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, let's go.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, let's go.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay, let's go.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, let's go.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ruben, this is no place for a...

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Big...

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Aaaaaah!

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Aaaaaah!

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wow!

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No!

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There it is.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We meet again, command block.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ruben, I think we made it angry.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Die!

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Aaaaaah!

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Aaaaaah!

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Holy moly!

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This thing will die!

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Aaaaaah!

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This thing will die!

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,555
Ruben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command

49
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,000
block.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to kill you.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The tractor beam!

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey you!

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're dead.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're dead.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're dead.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're dead.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're dead.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're dead.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're dead.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're dead.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're dead.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're dead.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're dead.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're dead.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're dead.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're dead.
