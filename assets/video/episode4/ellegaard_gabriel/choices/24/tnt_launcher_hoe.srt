00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Guys, check it out.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,480
We'll use the Pistons, the Redstone, and the TNT

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,560
to build a TNT launcher.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,742
Then I climb on and you guys blast me all the way into the

5
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:11,680
Witherstorm.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,120
Ha ha! Heck yeah! I love that idea.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh! Look out!

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,720
Petra!

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,920
Axel!

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Aaaaaaah!

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Aaaaaaah!

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Whoa!

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Gah!

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
I can't...hold on!

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
I got you!

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Lukas! You're here!

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Ocelots, distract that Witherstorm!

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,880
Hey you! Get a load of this!

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
Lukas, thank you.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Anything for a friend.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Now let's hurry up and build this thing!

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Okay, it's finished.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Quick! Climb on!

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,640
We all do.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Now go to walls that command block.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Reuben, this is no place for a...

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Petra!

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Aaaaaaah!

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Aaaaaaah!

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Go!

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
Ow!

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Whoa!

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
No!

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
No!

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
There it is.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
We meet again, command block.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Now it's time to destroy you.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Reuben, I think we made it angry.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Awesome weapon. Don't fail me now.

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Yeah!

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Aaaaaaah!

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Holy moly!

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Stay on time!

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Stay on time!

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,908
Reuben, whatever happens we have to destroy that command

50
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:21,360
block.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
The tractor beam!

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Hey you!
