00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Lukas, your friends could still be out there!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,600
I know! And that means I... I gotta go after them!

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,640
They might need me, Jesse.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,760
You can't just up and leave, Lukas. You're part of our team.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,280
And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
L-Lukas...

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,040
Look, you and me, we've made a pretty good team so far.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,760
I'd even call us friends.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,533
So I hope you'll understand why I need to go help my old

10
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:23,960
friends.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,760
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
If your heart's telling you to go...

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
Then you gotta go.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
Otherwise, you'd be... heartless, or something.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Thank you, Jesse.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
I'll find them.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,080
And then I'll find you again, too.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
I promise.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Thanks.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Hey, buddy. You doing okay?

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Of course you are.

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Wish I could say the same for everyone else.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,120
We've lost too many people already.
