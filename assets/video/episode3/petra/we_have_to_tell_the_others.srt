1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We have to tell the others.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This isn't a we thing.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Yes, it is. We're a team, and they all deserve to know.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Maybe. Look, I'll tell them. Eventually.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,000
You have to.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,332
It's just gonna cause panic, and we can't afford that right

7
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:17,700
now.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,000
If it becomes more of a thing, I'll tell everyone.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But let me do it.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hey, guys. I have an idea.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Magnus, help!

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, alright. But I have another idea.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is it yelling for Ellegaard?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, not anymore.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They aren't coming back.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They couldn't abandon us if they wanted to.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As long as we have... this!

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Flint and Steel? I don't get it.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's not... that's not what I meant to pull out.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hold on.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here, let me see it.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you mind?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I just want to see it.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can see it without touching it.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What if you can't get it to work?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's working fine.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Whoa!

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Soren'!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is the spot. It has to be.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Maybe.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is definitely it.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Get ready to dig, people.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who knows how far down that goes?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Anyone else have a better plan?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jesse's talking to you, Lucas.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, I just need a...

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hi-ya!

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's get to it, then.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are we cool?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a hole!

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Does that mean we're cool?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll find out!

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I guess that makes sense.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You dig, you get a hole.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not sure why I expected anything else.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That was my point.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, it wasn't.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Jesse's got this, you guys.
