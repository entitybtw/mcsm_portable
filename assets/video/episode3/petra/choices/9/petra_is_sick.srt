1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look, Lukas, Petra's sick.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How long have you known?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,520
A while, but she asked me not to say anything.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,860
The wither infected her with something.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,240
So everything I was worried about is true?

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,600
This is my fault, Jesse.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
Petra's wither sickness?

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,600
It's because of me.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,360
There's no way this is because of you.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,432
If I hadn't choked, you would have been able to pull Petra

11
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,180
out of that tractor beam sooner.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,800
For all we know, Petra didn't get sick until way after that.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Maybe you're right.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,014
If one of our best fighters is sick, do we even stand a

15
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:55,880
chance anymore?

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,745
Not like we haven't dealt with some grade A problems

17
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:00,840
before, but I just can't help feeling

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,760
kind of hopeless.
