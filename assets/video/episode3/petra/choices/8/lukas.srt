1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
What do you want?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,320
You haven't found a way out of here, have you?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Honestly, I haven't even been looking.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
I just...

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,320
I just need a little alone time right now.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
What's your problem, Lukas?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,002
Lukas, no matter how upset you get, you've got to keep it

8
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,000
together.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I know.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I do.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I just...

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Listen, I know I've been prickly, okay, but...

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Jesse, I think something's wrong with Petra.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I mean, you have to have noticed.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,746
I wish I could tell you, but I'm not supposed to talk about

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,000
it.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, talk about what?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Jesse, if I'm right about this, you have to tell me.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's not fooling anybody.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At least not me.
