1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
Everyone follow Lukas and let's pick up the pace. Okay.

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:04,620
Come on

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,813
Smooth back there Lukas. Thanks and you too, Jesse. Thanks

5
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:52,600
for giving me a shot

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,106
Hope that someday I love something as much as soren seems

8
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,040
to love stairs

9
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
I

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,000
Jesse can you give me a sec?

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,160
Need a hand. Oh, no, I can manage. Thanks

12
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,920
Really I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Oh

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
So many stairs

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
There's a ladder

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Better not be a long one

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,634
Whatever this is looks like that's the way in after you

18
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,800
dude here goes

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Oh

20
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Please don't say more stairs

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,040
You
