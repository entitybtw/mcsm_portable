1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Please don't die, Ellegaardd. Please, just hang on a little

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000
longer.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm trying, Jesse, but a little is all I've got left.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,492
Well, Soren, at least I finally got to be a real hero,

5
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:18,140
right?

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,140
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,473
All those people, they're alive. The Witherstorm didn't

8
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:33,140
kill them.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,140
Jesse, those people, you have to help them. All of them.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,140
Of course I'll save them. Every one of them.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,140
We're the good guys, right? That's what we do.

12
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Come on, Reuben, we've got a job to do.

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,915
You guys help the survivors. I need to make sure we find

14
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:19,140
the people who might be trapped.

15
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,678
Don't worry, it's all over now. My friends are going to

16
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:29,140
help you.

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,140
Thank you. Thank you.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,140
You're going to be okay, I promise.

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,140
I... thank you.

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,140
No, the command block, that's impossible.

21
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,587
I don't understand if Soren said the Formidabomb would

22
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:55,140
destroy it, but it looks fine.

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
What the...

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Guys, over here!

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,140
No, no! Somebody, help!

26
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
Somebody, help!

27
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,140
But I thought you were dead, I saw you!

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,140
What... what happened here?

29
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,140
I'll explain everything, just not right now.

30
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,140
I'll explain everything, just not right now.

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Come on, we've got to get out of here!

32
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Gabriel, let's go!

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Where is Gabriel?
