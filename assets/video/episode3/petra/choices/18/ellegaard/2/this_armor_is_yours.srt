1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Ellegaardd, I can't. This armor belongs to you.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,760
You earned it, Jesse.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,315
Well, Zoran, at least I finally got to be a real hero,

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:12,940
right?

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,953
All those people, they're alive. The Witherstorm didn't

6
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:27,520
kill them.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,920
Jesse, those people, you have to help them. All of them.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,520
Of course I'll save them. Every one of them.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,320
We're the good guys, right? That's what we do.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Come on, Reuben. We've got a job to do.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,320
You guys help the survivors.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I need to make sure we find the people who might be trapped.

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,678
Don't worry. It's all over now. My friends are gonna help

14
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:18,920
you.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Thank you. Thank you.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,920
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
I... thank you.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
No! The command block, that's impossible!

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,009
I don't understand. Zoran said the Formidabomb would

20
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,920
destroy it, but it... it looks fine.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
What the...

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Guys, over here!

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
No! No!

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Somebody, help!

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,320
But... I thought you were dead, I saw you!

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,720
What happened here?

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll explain everything, just not right now.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
Come on, we've gotta get out of here!

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Gabriel, let's go!

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Who's Gabriel?
