1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Jumping is the easy part, it's the landing that's hard.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,920
This one's mine.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jumping!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Jumping, get down!

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Who wants more?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're asking for more?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Jesse!

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hey, Ugly!

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Watch out!

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, Bonehead, I'm talking to you!

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Anytime now, Jesse!

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hold on!

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Reuben, wait up!

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jesse, incoming!

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, that hurt.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The amulet, it's over there!

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah!

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You
