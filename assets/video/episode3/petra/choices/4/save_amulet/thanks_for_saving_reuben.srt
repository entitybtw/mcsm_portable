00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I really appreciate you helping Reuben back there, Lukas.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Huh. I guess I did.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,704
You don't have to do it all yourself, you know. I could

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,000
help.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Like I said, thanks.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Jesse?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The amulet.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Soren must be close.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Uh, where'd he go?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You have got to be kidding me.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sounds like the grinder is backed up.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
With loot?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Go, go, go, go, go!

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Whoa!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Keep moving!

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Axel, look out!

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Take that, ugly!

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, you want some too?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm coming, buddy!

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have had enough of this!

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Take that!

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look at your face, spider!

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's two things I hate. It's running and monsters.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
An ant portal?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's the way out.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wait!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What? Look!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, no!

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Petra!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Get away from them!

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In your face, monsters!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here we go!

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Jump!

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, great!

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Just keeps getting better.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where's Axel?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was right behind me.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I swear, I'm not trying to do that.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Get off!

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, jeez.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you hurt?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I'm not crying. Just look.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So, what do we call that?

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A herd of Endermen?

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A flock of Endermen?

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A swarm?
