1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,275
Don't go getting any ideas Lukas. Gabriel gave that to me,

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:03,840
remember?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,840
Hang on a minute...

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
He's close!

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,500
Soren's close by!

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,540
He's gotta be...

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,880
this way!

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,780
Look how bright it is!

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,620
Sounds like the grinder is packed up!

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
With food?

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,060
Go go go go go!

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,040
sweeter than 18

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,540
this is huge

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,380
Wooho

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,480
长走

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
That's the way out.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Wait! What? Look!

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Oh no!

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Hector!

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Get away from them!

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
In your face, monsters!

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Here we go!

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Jump!

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Oh, great!

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Just keeps getting better.

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Where's Axel? He was right behind me.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Ha! See? I told you I'd pay you back.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Get off!

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Oh, geez.

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Are you hurt?

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,480
What? No, I'm not crying. Just look!

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Hide.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So, uh, what do we call that?

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
A herd of Endermen?

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
A flock of Endermen?

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
A swarm?

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
I don't know.
