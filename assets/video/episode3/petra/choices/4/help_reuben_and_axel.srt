1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Got to help them.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What about the ambulance?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You get it.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm coming, Reuben!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Get away from my pig!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Got it!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Jesse's behind you.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Get out!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No!

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ah!

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is everyone okay? We all good?

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, I am definitely not thirsty anymore.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're fine.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, no, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No!

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I knew you'd come for us. I just knew it.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Reuben has dows.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I owe you.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm just glad you're okay.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Both of you.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks, Jesse.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's something different about you, Jesse.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're...

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hold on.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is where all the loot gets sorted, right?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's exactly what it is.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
See that? Things are starting to turn around.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It looks like it's still working.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll just be real careful with it.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Keep it safe.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You
