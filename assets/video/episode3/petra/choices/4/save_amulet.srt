00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I've got to get the amulet. You help the others.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Whee!

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Come on, come on, come on, Jesse.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah, no.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Come on.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
What?

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
What?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh!

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh!

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ah!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ah!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah!

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh!

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh!

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah!

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah!

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh!

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh!

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, is everyone okay? We all good?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, I am definitely not thirsty anymore.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're fine.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, buddy. It's all right.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lukas.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,962
We might have had our differences, but you're all right in

34
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:27,500
my book.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Thanks, Axel.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
No, thank you. I'm gonna go look around.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
What?

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
What?

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Axel, no!

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, no!
