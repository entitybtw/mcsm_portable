1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's keep this between us for now.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,000
I was thinking the same thing.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,800
They might get upset or...

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,700
...I don't know.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Exactly.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,500
We don't know.

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,000
It's just gonna cause panic and...

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,000
...we can't afford that right now.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
If it becomes more of a thing...

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,300
...I'll tell everyone.

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,000
But...

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
...let me do it.

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,700
Hey guys...

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,100
...I have an idea.

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Okay?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Magnus, help!

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Well, alright.

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,700
But I have another idea.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,400
Is it yelling for Eligard?

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,100
Well, not anymore.

21
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,800
Look, they aren't coming back.

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,600
They couldn't abandon us if they wanted to.

23
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,200
As long as we have...

24
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,700
...this!

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,500
Flint and Steel?

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't get it.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,400
It's not...

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,200
...that's not what I meant to pull out.

29
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,800
Hold on.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh, this!

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,300
Here, let me see it.

32
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,000
Do you mind?

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,000
I just...

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
...want to see it.

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,200
You can see it without touching.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,200
If you can't get it to work...

37
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,600
It's working fine.

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,300
Soar it!

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,300
This is the spot it has to be.

40
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe.

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
This is definitely it.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Get ready to dig, people.

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,400
Who knows how far down that goes?

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
Anyone else have a better plan?

45
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,200
Jesse's talking to you, Lucas.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,000
I know.

47
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,900
I just...

48
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,600
...need to...

49
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,300
High-go!

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Let's get to it, then.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are we cool?

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
It's a hole!

53
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,000
Does that mean we're cool?

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
I'll find out!

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
I guess that makes sense.

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,900
You dig, you get a hole?

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,700
I just...

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,500
...want to see it.

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
You can see it without touching.

60
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,100
I just...

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
...want to see it.

62
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,400
I just...

63
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
...want to see it.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,100
I just...

65
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
...want to see it.

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I just...

67
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,500
...want to see it.

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
I just...

69
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,700
...want to see it.

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
It's a hole.

71
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm not sure why I expected anything else.

72
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
That was my point.

73
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,500
No it wasn't.

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Jesse's got this, you guys.
