1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
We have to tell the others.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,160
Your friends know that's a bad idea.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,840
You have to.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,960
It's just gonna cause panic,

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,600
and we can't afford that right now.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,480
When the time comes,

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,240
I'll share it with those that wish to know.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,840
Until then, I hope you can be discreet.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,520
Hey, guys, I have an idea.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,720
Okay.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,920
Magnus, help!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,960
Well, all right, but I have another idea.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,760
Is it yelling for Ellegaardd?

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,400
Well, not anymore.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Look, they aren't coming back.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,240
They couldn't abandon us if they wanted to.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,840
As long as we have...

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,240
this!

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,680
Flint and Steel? I don't get it.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,880
It's not... That's not what I meant to pull out.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
Hold on.

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,720
Uh... Oh, this!

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
Here, let me see it.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
Do you mind?

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,000
I just... don't see it.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
You can see it without touching.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
God! If you can't get it to work, it's working fine.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,840
Soar it!

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,320
This is the spot. It has to be.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
Maybe.

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
This is definitely it.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,120
Get ready to dig, people.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Who knows how far down that goes?

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Anyone else have a better plan?

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,520
Jesse's talking to you, Lukas.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,800
I know. I just... need a...

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,960
I know!

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,560
Let's get to it, then.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,280
Are we cool?

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
It's a hole!

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Does that mean we're cool?

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,600
I-I'll find out!

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,520
I guess that makes sense.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
You dig, you get a hole.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm not sure why I expected you to dig.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,800
You can't just walk in there and do nothing.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
You're gonna have to do something else.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,200
You're gonna have to do something else.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm not sure why I expected you to dig.

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm not sure why I expected anything else.

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
That was my point.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,160
No, it wasn't.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Jesse's got this, you guys.
