1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's keep this between us for now.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I was thinking the same thing.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They might get upset or... I don't know.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Exactly. We don't know.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,625
When the time comes, I'll share it with those that wish to

6
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:14,000
know.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Until then, I hope you can be discreet.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey guys, I have an idea.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Magnus, help!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, alright. But I have another idea.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is it yelling for Eligard?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, not anymore.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They aren't coming back.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They couldn't abandon us if they wanted to.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
As long as we have...

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This!

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Flint and Steel? I don't get it.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's not... That's not what I meant to pull out.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hold on.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This!

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here, let me see it.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you mind?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I just want to see it.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You can see it without touching.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Not if you can't get it to work.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's working fine.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Soar it!

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is the spot that has to be.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Maybe.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is definitely it.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Get ready to dig, people.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who knows how far down that goes?

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Anyone else have a better plan?

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Jesse's talking to you, Lucas.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I know. I just...

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I know!

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know!

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I know!

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I know!

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I know!

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's get to it, then.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are we cool?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a hole!

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Does that mean we're cool?

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll find out!

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I guess that makes sense. You dig, you get a hole.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not sure why I expected anything else.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That was my point.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, it wasn't.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jesse's got this, you guys.
