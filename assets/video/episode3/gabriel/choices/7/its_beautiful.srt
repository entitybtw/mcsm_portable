1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ah, so bright.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ah!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's my body, Axel. My broken, battered body.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hang on a second...

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What in the-- it's made of wool.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This tree... the grass... it's all... wool.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,558
You're telling me, that we've been resting all our hopes on

9
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:40,000
this guy,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,739
and the whole time he's been building some... totally

11
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,000
artificial Happyland?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Could it be that he just missed home?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you miss home, you go and visit.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You don't build an exact replica.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We came here for nothing!

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We CAME here for Soren, and for his Formidi-bomb.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's still the plan.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just look around, Jesse!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,470
If the greatest builder of all time has spent years working

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,000
on this,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
what're the chances he's even gonna have that bomb, huh?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've had enough crazy for one day!

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is he going to be okay?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Just give him some space.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He'll be okay.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So I'm probably looking for...

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If I were you, I'd be looking for a secret door,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and the secret mechanism to open said door.
