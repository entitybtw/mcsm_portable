1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
What do you want?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,240
You haven't found a way out of here, have you?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,200
Honestly, I haven't even been looking.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
I just...

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
I just need a little alone time right now.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
What's your problem, Lukas?

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,882
Lukas, no matter how upset you get, you've got to keep it

8
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:22,880
together.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
I know.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
I do.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
I just...

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Listen, I know I've been prickly, okay?

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,880
But...

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Jesse, I think something's wrong... with Gabriel.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
I mean, you have to have noticed.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,562
I wish I could tell you, but I'm not supposed to talk about

17
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:46,880
it.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Wait, talk about what?

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Jesse, if I'm right about this, you have to tell me.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,880
It's not fooling anybody.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
At least not me.
