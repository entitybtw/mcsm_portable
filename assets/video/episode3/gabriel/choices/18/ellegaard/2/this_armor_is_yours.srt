1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Ellegaardd, I can't. This armor belongs to you.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,760
You earned it, Jesse.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,315
Well, Soren, at least I finally got to be a real hero,

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:12,940
right?

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,956
All those people, they're alive. The Witherstorm didn't

6
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:27,520
kill them.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,920
Jesse, those people, you have to help them. All of them.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,720
Of course I'll save them. Every one of them.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,420
We're the good guys, right? That's what we do.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Come on, Reuben. We've got a job to do.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
You guys help the survivors.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,920
I need to make sure we find the people who might be trapped.

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,278
Don't worry. It's all over now. My friends are gonna help

14
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:18,520
you.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Thank you. Thank you.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I... thank you.

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
No. The command block, that's impossible.

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,025
I don't understand. Soren said the Femida Bomb would

20
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,520
destroy it, but it... it looks fine.

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Fine?

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
What the...

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Guys, over here!

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,520
No! No! Somebody, help!

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,520
But... I thought you were dead. I saw you!

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
What happened here?

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll explain everything, just not right now.

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Get out of here!

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Come on! We've got to get out of here!

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Petra, let's go!

31
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Petra, let's go!
