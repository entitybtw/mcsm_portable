1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,266
Please don't go, Magnus. Please just hang on a little

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:03,760
longer.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,880
I'm hanging, but only for a little while.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,840
Hey, at least I finally got to be a real hero, right?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,960
All those people, they're alive.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,880
The wither storm didn't kill them.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,200
Jesse, you gotta help them. All of them.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,720
Of course I'll save them. Every one of them.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,040
We're the good guys, right? That's what we do.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,800
Come on, Reuben. We've got a job to do.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
You guys help the survivors.

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,880
I need to make sure we find the people who might be trapped.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,638
Don't worry. It's all over now. My friends are gonna help

14
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:21,880
you.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Thank you. Thank you.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I... thank you.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,880
No. The command block, that's impossible.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,385
I don't understand. Soren said the Formidabomb would

20
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,880
destroy it, but it... it looks fine.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
What the...

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Guys, over here!

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,880
No! No!

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Somebody, help!

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,880
But... I thought you were dead. I saw you.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
What happened here?

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll explain everything just... not right now.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Come on, we've gotta get out of here!

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Petra, let's go!

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Who's Petra?
