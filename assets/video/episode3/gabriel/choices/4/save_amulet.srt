1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I've got to get the amulet. You help the others.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Whee!

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Come on, come, come, Jesse.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah, come on.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Come on.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Oh!

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Yeah!

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Yeah!

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Oh!

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Yeah!

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh!

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah!

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Yeah!

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Yeah!

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh!

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Oh!

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Yeah!

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Yeah!

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
What?

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Is everyone okay? We all good?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, I am definitely not thirsty anymore.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're fine.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, buddy. It's all right.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lucas, we might have had our differences,

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
but you're all right in my book.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Thanks, Axel.

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
No, thank you. I'm gonna go look around.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
What?
