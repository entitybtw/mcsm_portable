1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,275
Don't go getting any ideas Lukas. Gabriel gave that to me,

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:03,840
remember?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,840
Hang on a minute...

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
He's close!

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,500
Soren's close by!

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,540
He's gotta be...

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,880
this way!

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,780
Look how bright it is!

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,620
Sounds like the grinder is packed up!

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
With food?

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,060
Go go go go go!

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,620
Growl...!

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,820
Growl...!

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,100
Whoa!

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,240
Keep moving!

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
That's the way out.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Wait! What? Look!

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Oh no!

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Gabriel! Get away from them!

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Get in your face, monsters!

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Here we go!

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Jump!

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Oh, great!

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Just keeps getting better.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Where's Axel? He was right behind me.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Ha! See? I told you I'd pay you back.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Get off!

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Oh, geez.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Are you hurt?

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
What? No, I'm not crying. Just look.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Hide.

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
So, uh, what do we call that?

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
A herd of Endermen?

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
A flock of Endermen?

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
A swarm?

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,240
So, uh, what do we call that?

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
A herd of Endermen?

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
A flock of Endermen?

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
A swarm?
