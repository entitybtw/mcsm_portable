1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Man, would it kill you to warn somebody?! That was terrifying!

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,600
I'm sorry, but it might indeed, kill me.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
Did you guys hear that?

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,400
Hear what?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,200
All that stuff whispering, "Take me. Take me now."

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,740
I know this is cool, but the only things we need in here

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,600
are the ingredients for the Formidi-Bomb.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
The loot says you're wrong.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,900
I'll just fetch the Super TNT. It's right up -- there!

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,800
How are you gonna get up there?

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
Oh, I have my ways...

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Oh, and feel free to help yourselves!

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,500
Find us some gunpowder.
