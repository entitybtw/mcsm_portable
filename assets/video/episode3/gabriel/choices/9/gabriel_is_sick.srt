1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Look, Lukas, Gabriel's sick.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,520
How long have you known?

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,520
A while, but he asked me not to say anything.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,800
The wither infected him with something.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,160
So everything I was worried about is true?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,520
This is my fault, Jesse.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Gabriel's wither sickness, it's because of me.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,440
There's no way this is because of you.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,666
If I hadn't choked, you would have been able to pull

10
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,080
Gabriel out of that tractor beam

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
sooner.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,776
For all we know, Gabriel didn't get sick until way after

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,280
that.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
Maybe you're right.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,503
If one of our best fighters is sick, do we even stand a

16
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,360
chance anymore?

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,225
Not like we haven't dealt with some grade A problems

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,320
before, but I just can't help feeling

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
kind of hopeless.
