1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
They can't hurt us if we don't look at them, right?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,400
So we just keep our eyes closed.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Forever.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
One constant about Endermen is that they hate water.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
If we can force that fountain to overflow somehow...

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Jesse, you still have the Endermen suit.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Put that on and you'll be able to safely reach the fountain.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,769
Just when I thought I'd never have to smell this thing

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,200
again.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Good luck, dude.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
We'll, um... all watch from here then.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Where it's safe.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Phew.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
Try not to die.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, everybody, let's go!

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
What's the holdup?

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
They're everywhere.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
How are we supposed to get through this?

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I mean physically and psychologically.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Say we somehow make it.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
You can't see how this won't become a reoccurring nightmare.
