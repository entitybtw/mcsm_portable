1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,689
It is said that within every loss, every challenge...

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,000
...and every failure, there is a gift.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,598
And when our band of unlikely adventurers are tasked with

4
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:14,240
saving the world from the

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,445
coming storm, they will bring together the bravest and the

6
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,040
brightest to stop it.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,874
But finding the last and most elusive member of the Order

8
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,960
of the Stone and his legendary

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Formidi-bomb would prove their most perilous mission yet.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,273
For some would rather our heroes' story end here, shutting

11
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:38,000
the door on their adventure forever.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,419
But like all doors, when one closes, another is bound to

13
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,000
open.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Stop him!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You won't get away.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Watch it!

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Get out of the way!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Everyone okay?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I felt all of that.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That was one heck of a landing, Axel.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He mostly used his face.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We need to find Soren.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I still can't figure out how Ivor made the door close.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe we should focus more on how it opens.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's basically what I said.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you okay?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Of course. Why would you feel the need to ask?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just checking in.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am a-oh...

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
a-oh...

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My goodness...

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just give it a second..

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do not be frightened or alarmed.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it's getting worse.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm in a lot of pain.
