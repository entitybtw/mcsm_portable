The battle with the Witherstorm sapped\n\n3\n00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,000\nthe last of my strength. Considerable though it was.\n\n4\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000\nYou need to rest.\n\n5\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nYou're right, I do.\n\n6\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,142\nLook, Jesse, wherever you guys go next, give him some time\n\n7\n00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:24,000\nto get his strength back.\n\n8\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nThe problem is we don't have time.\n\n9\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,900\nJesse's right. In fact, it might be best if my journey ends\n\n10\n00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,000\nhere. This cave is safe, easy to defend.\n\n11\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,866\nIf that's what you feel is best, then I support it. You've\n\n12\n00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,000\nbeen through too much as it is.\n\n13\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,682\nThank you, Jesse. I'm just sorry that I can't be there for\n\n14\n00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:46,000\nyou.\n\n15\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nMe too.\n\n16\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,333\nNothing had to turn out like this. If the order had just\n\n17\n00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:59,952\nbeen different, if we'd made smarter choices, Iver wouldn't\n\n18\n00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:05,285\nhave turned into a maniac and, well, maybe Elagard would\n\n19\n00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,000\nstill be alive.\n\n20\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nCome on, let's not talk about the old days.\n\n21\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,080\nBut how can we not? So many lives torn asunder, the world\n\n22\n00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000\nripped to pieces.\n\n\n———\nassets/video/episode4/ellegaard_gabriel/choices/18/that_was_amazing.srt\n———\n1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000\nThat was absolutely amazing!\n\n2\n00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,000\nThey didn't call us the Order of the Stone for nothing.\n\n3\n00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,300\nI wonder if that story will help me solve this puzzle.\n\n4\n00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,000\nBow and arrow, great weapons.\n\n5\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nThat's a sword. So Soren rode the dragon, huh?\n\n6\n00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500\nHey Reuben, give me a boost, will ya?\n\n7\n00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500\nAha!\n\n8\n00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500\nYes!\n\n9\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000\nYes, that's it!\n\n10\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nAnd then Gabriel poked it dead with a sword.\n\n11\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nBravo! You did it!\n\n12\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nThere's the book.\n\n13\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nWait, aren't those the Ender crystals?\n\n14\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500\nLike the real ones?\n\n15\n00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000\nNo, it can't be.\n\n16\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,638\nBut those things were destroyed in your big heroic battle\n\n17\n00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,000\nwith the Ender dragon, right, Soren?\n\n18\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nHe kept them. The fool actually kept them.\n\n19\n00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500\nSoren, you said destroying these crystals was the key to\n\n20\n00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000\ndefeating the Ender dragon.\n\n21\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nYou did kill the Ender dragon, right?\n\n22\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,532\nJesse, this isn't... this isn't what it looks like. Our\n\n23\n00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:54,000\nstory, the story, it's mostly true. I swear, I swear.\n\n24\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nSoren, I want the truth and I want it now.\n\n25\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nI can't. We swore never to speak of it.\n\n26\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nI don't care.\n\n27\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,344\nI'm afraid I haven't been honest with you, Jesse. We did\n\n28\n00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:12,000\ndefeat the Ender dragon, but it wasn't exactly like I said.\n\n29\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nHow not exactly?\n\n30\n00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000\nWe got rid of it, but we didn't kill it per se.\n\n31\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000\nSo what did you do to it?\n\n32\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nWe didn't do anything. We used the command block.\n\n33\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nYou used the command block to defeat the Ender dragon?\n\n34\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000\nI'm afraid so.\n\n35\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,032\nUnderstand, when I found that blasted block, we were\n\n36\n00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,000\nnobodies.\n\n37\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,833\nBut with its help, we became stronger, faster. We could do\n\n38\n00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,000\nso much more.\n\n39\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,928\nThe others had no idea what I was doing. Yet the more I\n\n40\n00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:59,000\nused it, the more we came to depend on it.\n\n41\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000\nI knew it was only so long before someone would find out.\n\n42\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000\nSo I concocted a plan.\n\n43\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,232\nI would use the command block to blink the Ender dragon out\n\n44\n00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,000\nof existence.\n\n45\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000\nSecuring our statu",
